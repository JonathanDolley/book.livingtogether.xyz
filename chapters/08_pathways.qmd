## Prompt 1:

What is the legal form in Lichtenstein which allows a foundation to own a for profit business?

## Answer 1:

In Liechtenstein, a foundation can legally own a for-profit business. The legal form that allows this is a **Foundation (Stiftung)**.

Here's a breakdown of the key points regarding foundations and commercial activities in Liechtenstein:

* **Foundation Types:** Liechtenstein distinguishes between "private-benefit" and "common-benefit" foundations.
* **Commercial Activity:**
    * A **private-benefit foundation** (often used for asset protection or estate planning) can engage in commercial activities if they are necessary for the proper investment and management of the foundation's assets. This includes holding shares in companies and other assets.
    * A **common-benefit foundation** (charitable foundation) can only carry out commercial activities if they directly serve its charitable purpose or are specifically permitted by law.
* **Commercial Register:** Any foundation that conducts business on a commercial basis must be entered into the Liechtenstein Commercial Register. This registration makes certain details of the foundation public.
* **Oversight:** Foundations that engage in commercial activities are subject to an auditing requirement.

In short, a Liechtenstein Foundation is a flexible legal entity that can be structured to hold and manage a for-profit business, as long as it is established for the purpose of managing assets and not for direct commercial operation in the manner of a typical company. The key is that the foundation holds the business, rather than directly conducting the business itself for its primary purpose.

## Prompt 2:

How do the rules for foundations compare between Norway and Lichtenstein?

## Answer 2:

Foundations in Norway (Stiftelsen) and Liechtenstein (Stiftung) share a common civil law heritage, but their rules and applications have evolved to reflect the specific legal and economic environments of each country. Here is a comparison of their key differences:

### 1. Purpose and Flexibility

* **Liechtenstein:** The **Stiftung** is renowned for its flexibility. It can be established for a wide range of purposes, including charitable, family, and private-benefit purposes. This flexibility makes it a popular tool for wealth management, asset protection, and estate planning. A key feature is the ability to create a "private-benefit foundation" which serves the interests of a specific group of people, such as family members.
* **Norway:** The **Stiftelsen** is primarily seen as an independent, self-owned legal entity for a specified, long-term purpose. While it can have commercial activities, its main purpose must be non-profit or for a specific, idealistic cause. The Norwegian system is more focused on ensuring that foundations serve a public good or a clearly defined purpose, with a strong emphasis on accountability and oversight by the public authorities.

### 2. Commercial Activities

* **Liechtenstein:** As mentioned in the previous answer, a Liechtenstein foundation can own a for-profit business, as long as the commercial activities are necessary for the proper management of the foundation's assets. The foundation itself is generally not intended to directly conduct commercial operations as its primary purpose, but rather to hold and manage assets, including shareholdings in commercial companies.
* **Norway:** Norwegian law distinguishes between "ordinary foundations" and "commercial foundations." A **commercial foundation** (erhvervsdrivende stiftelse) is a specific type of foundation that can engage in commercial activities. However, it must have a clear business purpose and is subject to stricter rules, including a higher minimum capital requirement (NOK 200,000) and a Norwegian business address.

### 3. Oversight and Regulation

* **Liechtenstein:** Foundations are subject to regulation by the Liechtenstein Foundation Supervisory Authority (STIVA) and must be entered into the Commercial Register if they engage in commercial activities. The level of public disclosure can vary. Private-benefit foundations generally have a higher degree of privacy, with the identity of the founder and beneficiaries not being entered in the public register.
* **Norway:** All foundations in Norway are subject to the supervision of the Norwegian Gaming and Foundation Authority. This authority is responsible for ensuring that the foundation's activities are in line with its stated purpose and with the provisions of the Foundations Act. All foundations must be registered in the central Foundation Register, which is public.

### 4. Capital Requirements

* **Liechtenstein:** The minimum capital for a foundation is relatively low, typically CHF/EUR/USD 30,000.
* **Norway:** The minimum primary capital is NOK 100,000 for an ordinary foundation and NOK 200,000 for a commercial foundation.

### 5. Tax Considerations

* **Liechtenstein:** Charitable foundations can apply for tax exemption. Private-benefit foundations are subject to a flat tax rate. Liechtenstein has historically been known for its favorable tax environment for foundations, particularly for wealth and asset management.
* **Norway:** Foundations and non-profit organizations are generally exempt from income tax on income related to their non-profit, idealistic purposes. However, they may be subject to taxation on commercial activities that fall outside this scope.

In summary, while both countries recognize foundations as a legal entity, Liechtenstein's framework is more geared towards a flexible, asset-holding vehicle for private and family wealth, with a strong focus on asset protection and privacy. Norway's system, while accommodating commercial activities for specific types of foundations, is more focused on public purpose and transparency, with a more regulated and publicly supervised environment.

## Promt 3:

What about foundations in the uk?

## Answer 3:

Unlike countries with civil law systems like Liechtenstein and Norway, the term "foundation" in the UK does not refer to a specific legal entity. Instead, a "foundation" is a concept, often used to describe an organization that has an endowment of capital and uses the income from that capital to make grants for a particular purpose.

In the UK, these organizations are typically established using one of the following legal forms:

### Charitable Trusts

This is the most common legal structure for what is often called a "foundation" in the UK. A **trust** is not a separate legal entity; it's a legal relationship where a person (the founder or "settlor") transfers assets to a group of people (the trustees) who hold and manage those assets for the benefit of a specified purpose or group of beneficiaries. Charitable trusts are governed by a trust deed and are often registered with the Charity Commission.

### Companies Limited by Guarantee

Another popular structure is a company limited by guarantee. This creates a separate legal entity from its founders and members, offering limited liability. This is often used for larger "foundations" that may need to own property, enter into contracts, or employ staff. While a company limited by guarantee is not a charitable structure by default, it can be registered with the Charity Commission to become a **charitable company**.

### Charitable Incorporated Organisations (CIOs)

Introduced to provide a legal structure specifically for charities, a **CIO** is a separate legal entity that is registered and regulated solely by the Charity Commission, without the need for additional registration with Companies House. This is a popular choice for new charities as it provides limited liability for trustees without the administrative burden of being a company.

***

### Key Differences from Liechtenstein

The UK legal system is based on **common law**, whereas Liechtenstein's is based on **civil law**. This fundamental difference leads to the following key distinctions:

* **Legal Form:** In Liechtenstein, a "Stiftung" is a distinct legal entity with its own personality, separate from its founder. In the UK, the concept of a "foundation" is typically implemented through a trust or a company.
* **Purpose:** The UK system is heavily focused on the **public benefit** principle for a foundation to be a registered charity. A "foundation" in the UK must have a charitable purpose. While there are non-charitable trusts, they are generally used for private wealth management, and are subject to different tax rules. In contrast, Liechtenstein's "private-benefit foundation" allows for asset holding for a specific group of people, such as a family, without a public benefit requirement.
* **Privacy vs. Transparency:** Liechtenstein offers a high degree of privacy for its private-benefit foundations. In the UK, most charitable trusts and charitable companies must be registered with the Charity Commission, with their governing documents and financial accounts being publicly available.

## Prompt 4:

What would be the advantage of having a foundation in Lichtenstein as a member of a cooperative organisation?

## Answer 4:

Having a Liechtenstein foundation as a member of a cooperative organization can offer several advantages, primarily stemming from the foundation's unique legal characteristics. The core benefits relate to asset protection, succession planning, and administrative efficiency.

### 1. Asset Protection and Separation

* **Limited Liability:** A Liechtenstein foundation is a separate legal entity. This means the assets held by the foundation, including its membership in the cooperative, are legally distinct from the founder's personal assets. This provides a high degree of protection against claims from personal creditors of the founder.
* **Shielding the Cooperative:** By holding a membership in the cooperative through a foundation, the cooperative's operations are insulated from any personal legal or financial issues of the foundation's founder or beneficiaries. The foundation's assets are what is at risk, not the founder's personal wealth.

### 2. Perpetual Succession and Succession Planning

* **Continuity of Membership:** A cooperative, by nature, has an open and often changing membership. However, a key challenge for any member is planning for what happens to their stake upon their death or incapacitation. A Liechtenstein foundation offers a perfect solution for this. The foundation has perpetual existence, meaning it does not cease to exist upon the death of its founder. The membership in the cooperative can be held by the foundation indefinitely, ensuring continuity and stability for the cooperative without the need for complex inheritance or probate procedures.
* **Defined Beneficiaries:** The founder of the foundation can define the beneficiaries who will benefit from the foundation's assets (including the cooperative membership and any profits it generates) according to their wishes. This allows for a clear and structured way to pass on the benefits of cooperative membership to heirs or other designated individuals without having to transfer the membership itself. The foundation becomes the long-term vehicle for managing the benefits of the cooperative interest.

### 3. Administrative and Governance Efficiency

* **Centralized Management:** The foundation's council can manage the cooperative membership on behalf of the beneficiaries. This is particularly useful in situations where there are multiple beneficiaries, such as a family. Instead of each beneficiary having to individually manage their rights and obligations in the cooperative, the foundation's professional administration can handle it. This can prevent disputes and ensure that decisions regarding the cooperative are made in a unified and professional manner.
* **Privacy:** A key feature of private-benefit foundations in Liechtenstein is the high degree of privacy they offer. While the foundation itself may be registered, the identity of the founder and beneficiaries is typically not publicly available. This can be an advantage for individuals who wish to participate in a cooperative without their personal identity being directly linked to the organization.

### 4. Tax and Financial Structuring

* **Flexible Tax Treatment:** Liechtenstein has a favorable tax environment. While the specific tax implications depend on the jurisdictions involved, a Liechtenstein foundation can be structured in a way that provides tax advantages, particularly with regard to capital gains and dividend income from its assets.
* **Asset Accumulation:** The foundation can accumulate and manage any profits or distributions received from the cooperative. This allows for long-term growth of the assets for the benefit of the foundation's purpose or beneficiaries, separate from the beneficiaries' personal finances.

In essence, a Liechtenstein foundation serves as a robust and flexible "container" to hold the cooperative membership. It separates the cooperative interest from the personal affairs of the founder, provides a durable structure for long-term succession, and offers a private and professionally managed vehicle for the benefit of its beneficiaries.

## Prompt 5:

Give me some really life examples of foundations in Norway and Lichtenstein which have public benefit missions and commercial activities.

## Answer 5:

You've asked for real-life examples of foundations in both Norway and Liechtenstein that combine public benefit missions with commercial activities. This is an excellent question that highlights the unique legal frameworks in each country.

### **Norway** 🇳🇴

In Norway, a foundation with commercial activities is known as a **"commercial foundation" (erhvervsdrivende stiftelse)**. They are distinct from traditional non-profit foundations because their primary purpose is to operate a business, with the profits being used for a public or charitable purpose.

* **Tinius Trust (Tinius Stiftelsen):** This is a prime example. The Tinius Trust owns a majority stake in **Blommenholm Industrier AS**, which in turn controls the Norwegian media company **Schibsted**. The trust's purpose is to act as a long-term, stable owner of Schibsted and to protect the company's independence, credibility, and pluralism. The commercial activity (controlling Schibsted) generates the income that the foundation uses to support its public benefit mission of promoting freedom of the press and independent media.
    

* **Sparebankstiftelsen DNB:** This is one of Norway's largest foundations. It was formed from the savings bank part of DNB, a major Norwegian financial services group. The foundation's commercial activity is its ownership of a significant portion of shares in **DNB ASA**. The dividends from these shares are then used to fund a wide range of public benefit projects, particularly in the arts, culture, and community development.

***

### **Liechtenstein** 🇱🇮

Liechtenstein's legal framework allows for **"common-benefit foundations"** that engage in commercial activities, but only if those activities are directly related to or serve the foundation's purpose. The more common model, however, is a foundation that **holds assets**—including commercial businesses—rather than directly operating them.

* **Aage V. Jensen Charity Foundation (Aage V. Jensen Wohltätigkeitsstiftung):** This foundation is a great example of a Liechtenstein common-benefit foundation with commercial activities. While its primary purpose is nature conservation and wildlife protection, it achieves this by acquiring and managing vast natural areas and habitats globally. This includes owning and operating properties like the **Maremani Nature Reserve** in South Africa, which can involve commercial operations such as eco-tourism or sustainable land management. The income from these activities directly serves its public mission.
    

* **The Bergesen Foundation (Bergesenstiftelsen):** Although founded by a Norwegian family, its structure and operations illustrate how a foundation can be established in a jurisdiction like Liechtenstein. While its main purpose is to support public benefit projects, it often has commercial interests and real estate holdings to generate the income required for its grants. This model of having a portfolio of income-generating assets to fuel a charitable purpose is very common in Liechtenstein.

## Prompt 6: 

Is it possible to have a river with legal identity represented on the board of a foundation in either country?

## Answer 6:

This is a fascinating and forward-thinking question that touches on the emerging legal concept of "rights of nature" and its intersection with traditional corporate and foundation law.

The short answer is **no, not under current law in either Norway or Liechtenstein.**

Here's a detailed breakdown of why this is the case and how the issue is handled in each country's legal and cultural context.

### The Concept of Legal Personhood for Rivers

The idea of granting a river a legal identity or "personhood" is a relatively new and groundbreaking legal development. It means that the river is no longer just property to be owned, but a living entity with rights, such as the right to flow, be free from pollution, and have a healthy ecosystem. This has happened in a few notable cases worldwide:

* **New Zealand:** The Whanganui River was the first to be granted legal personhood.
* **Colombia:** The Atrato River and the Colombian Amazon have been granted legal rights.
* **India:** The Ganges and Yamuna rivers were given the rights of a "living person," though this ruling was later challenged.

In these cases, the river cannot represent itself. Instead, a "guardian" or "board of guardians" is appointed to act on its behalf and represent its interests in legal matters. This guardian role is crucial to the concept.

### Why It's Not Possible in Norway or Liechtenstein

#### **1. The Legal Definition of a "Person"**

Both Norway and Liechtenstein's legal systems are based on a distinction between a "natural person" (a human being) and a "legal person" (a corporation, foundation, or other legal entity).

* **Norway:** A foundation board must consist of at least two members who are "natural persons" (individuals) or "legal entities" as defined by Norwegian law, such as another company. There is no legal precedent or framework in place to recognize a river as a legal entity capable of holding a seat on a foundation board.
* **Liechtenstein:** The Liechtenstein Persons and Companies Act (PGR) similarly defines who can be a member of a foundation council. It specifies that members can be "natural persons" or "legal entities," but it does not extend this definition to natural objects like a river. A river does not fit the legal criteria for a foundation, company, or any other legal entity that could hold such a position.

#### **2. The Role of the Board**

A board member of a foundation has specific duties and liabilities, including:

* **Fiduciary Duty:** The duty to act in the best interests of the foundation and its purpose.
* **Administrative Tasks:** Responsibilities for finance, governance, and legal compliance.
* **Accountability:** Legal and financial liability for the foundation's actions.

A river, as a natural entity, cannot perform these tasks. While a guardian can act on its behalf in a legal context, this guardian would not be the river itself. The legal person on the board would be the *guardian* (a human or another legal entity), not the river.

### How These Countries Address the Issue of Nature's Rights

While a river cannot sit on a board, both Norway and Liechtenstein have robust legal frameworks for environmental protection.

* **Norway:** Norway has a strong tradition of environmental law and public participation. Environmental organizations (NGOs) often have standing to sue to protect nature on behalf of the public interest. The government, through agencies and legislation, holds the responsibility for the stewardship of natural resources.
* **Liechtenstein:** Liechtenstein has comprehensive environmental protection laws and, as a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), is subject to EU environmental directives. Charitable foundations can be established with the specific purpose of environmental protection, nature conservation, or ecological research. These foundations can then act as a legal advocate for a particular river or natural area. For example, a foundation could own land along a river to protect its habitat, effectively acting as a steward.

In summary, while the concept of "rights of nature" is gaining traction globally, it has not yet reached a point in the legal systems of Norway or Liechtenstein where a natural entity like a river could be represented on the board of a foundation. The current legal structures are not set up to accommodate a river as a legal person in the same way they do a human or a company. The most likely approach in these countries would be for a human-led organization or a foundation to take on the role of a legal advocate or "guardian" for the river.

## Prompt 7:

Can a cooperative or association have a region the board of such foundations?

## Answer 7:

Yes, in both Norway and Liechtenstein, a cooperative or an association can be a **legal entity** represented on the board of a foundation. The key is that they are considered "legal persons" in the eyes of the law, which qualifies them to hold a position on a foundation's board.

Here's a breakdown for each country:

### Norway 🇳🇴
In Norway, a **cooperative (samvirkeforetak)** or an **association (forening)** is a legal person, separate from its members. Norwegian foundation law, specifically the Foundations Act, allows for both natural persons and legal entities to serve on a foundation's board.

* **Cooperative on a Board:** A cooperative could be appointed to a foundation board to represent the interests of its members, especially if the foundation's purpose aligns with the cooperative's mission. For instance, a cooperative of dairy farmers could be on the board of a foundation dedicated to sustainable agriculture. This provides a direct line of communication between a specific group of stakeholders and the foundation.
* **Administrative Requirements:** When a legal entity like a cooperative is on a board, it must appoint a human representative to physically attend meetings and vote. This representative acts on behalf of the cooperative, following its internal governance rules.

***

### Liechtenstein 🇱🇮
Liechtenstein's legal framework for foundations is highly flexible and also permits legal entities to be on the foundation council (the board). The **Persons and Companies Act (PGR)** explicitly states that the foundation council must consist of at least two members, which can be either **natural persons or legal entities**.

* **Association on a Board:** An association can be appointed to a Liechtenstein foundation's board to ensure its purpose is carried out in line with the association's mission. This is a common practice for foundations set up to support a particular cause. For example, a foundation dedicated to historical preservation could have a local historical association on its board to provide expert guidance and oversight.
* **Representation and Governance:** Similar to Norway, the legal entity (cooperative or association) must designate a person to represent it and exercise its voting rights on the foundation board. This structure ensures that the interests of a group or organization are formally and legally represented in the foundation's governance.

### Comparison
| Feature | Norway | Liechtenstein |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal Status of Coop/Assoc** | A legal person. | A legal person. |
| **Board Member Eligibility**| Natural and legal persons. | Natural and legal entities. |
| **Primary Advantage** | Direct representation of a stakeholder group's interests. | Flexible governance and expert representation. |
| **Operational Detail** | Requires a designated human representative to act on its behalf. | Requires a designated human representative to act on its behalf. |

In both countries, the legal framework is well-established for this type of arrangement. It's a key mechanism for ensuring that the governance of a foundation is not just in the hands of individuals but can also include the formal, institutional voice of a collective organization.

## Prompt 8:

What is the legal framework for foundations in Korea?

## Answer 8:

The legal framework for foundations in South Korea is primarily governed by the **Civil Act (민법)**. Unlike the common law system of the UK or the highly flexible civil law of Liechtenstein, South Korea's system is a more traditional civil law model with a strong emphasis on public benefit and regulatory oversight.

Here are the key aspects of the legal framework:

### 1. Legal Status and Purpose
* **Juristic Persons:** Under the Civil Act, foundations (재단법인, jaedan-beobin) are classified as "juristic persons" (법인, beobin), meaning they have a legal identity separate from their founders. This is similar to a corporation or a company.
* **Non-Profit Purpose:** Foundations must be established for a non-profit purpose. The Civil Act specifies that they can be formed for purposes related to "art, charity, science, religion, social intercourse or otherwise not engaged in profit." This is a crucial distinction from the flexibility found in Liechtenstein's private-benefit foundations.

### 2. Establishment and Oversight
* **Articles of Incorporation:** The establishment of a foundation requires the creation of Articles of Incorporation (정관, jeong-gwan), which must contain information on the foundation's purpose, name, address, asset management, and dissolution rules.
* **Government Approval:** Unlike in some other jurisdictions, a foundation cannot be established merely by registration. It requires explicit **permission from the competent authorities** (the relevant government ministry or agency) to be incorporated. The authorities review the application to ensure the foundation's purpose is genuinely non-profit and that it has sufficient assets to fulfill its mission.
* **Registration:** Once permission is granted, the foundation must be registered with the local registry office. This registration makes the foundation's key details public.

### 3. Assets and Funding
* **Endowment:** A foundation must be endowed with a certain amount of property by the founder. This initial capital is what forms the basis of the foundation. The founder's role is to provide the assets and the deed of incorporation; they do not retain control over the foundation's operations.
* **Asset Administration:** The Articles of Incorporation must specify how the foundation's funds will be managed and administered to achieve its non-profit purpose. Any changes to the articles regarding these funds require government approval.

### 4. Governance and Dissolution
* **Board of Directors:** A foundation is managed by a board of directors (이사, isa). The board is responsible for carrying out the foundation's purpose and managing its assets.
* **Auditing:** Foundations are subject to regular audits and oversight by the supervising government authority to ensure they are adhering to their stated purpose and not engaging in prohibited activities.
* **Dissolution:** A foundation can be dissolved for reasons such as bankruptcy, achieving its purpose, or a legal order. Upon dissolution, the remaining assets are transferred to another non-profit organization with a similar purpose, as defined in the articles.

### 5. Tax and Commercial Activities
* **Taxation:** Foundations in South Korea generally enjoy tax exemptions on income related to their non-profit purpose. However, they are subject to taxation on commercial or profit-making activities that are not directly related to or necessary for their public benefit mission. This is a critical point that limits their ability to own and operate for-profit businesses in the same way as a Norwegian commercial foundation.

### Comparison to Other Countries

* **Liechtenstein:** Korea's foundations are much less flexible. The private-benefit foundation, so central to Liechtenstein's system for wealth management and asset protection, has no direct equivalent in South Korea. The emphasis in Korea is strictly on public interest.
* **Norway:** While Norway has a specific legal form for "commercial foundations" (erhvervsdrivende stiftelse), which explicitly allows for commercial activities to fund a public mission, the South Korean framework is stricter. Foundations can receive income from commercial activities, but the primary purpose of the foundation itself must remain non-profit, and the activities must not be the foundation's raison d'être.
* **UK:** The UK's use of "trusts" and "companies limited by guarantee" for charitable purposes is conceptually different from Korea's single, formalized legal entity. While both systems are focused on public benefit, the UK's legal structures are more of a a procedural framework for achieving charitable status, whereas in Korea, the foundation (재단법인) is a distinct legal form itself.

## Prompt 9:

What measures exist in each country to prevent a foundation changing its purpose?

## Answer 9:

Foundations in all four countries have legal and regulatory measures to prevent a change in their fundamental purpose, as a foundation is, by definition, an asset irrevocably dedicated to a specific mission. The level of difficulty in making such a change varies significantly based on the country's legal tradition and the type of foundation.

---

### **Liechtenstein** 🇱🇮

Liechtenstein's system is built on the principle of the founder's will, but it also provides a framework for controlled change.

* **Founder's Intent:** The foundation's purpose is a core element of its legal identity. It's established by the founder and is considered the "essentialia negotii" (the essential element of a legal transaction). The purpose cannot be easily changed after the foundation is established.
* **Strict Conditions for Change:** An amendment to the purpose is only legally permitted under very specific circumstances:
    * The purpose has become **unattainable, impermissible, or irrational**. For example, if a foundation was created to fund research on a disease that has been completely cured, its purpose would be considered unattainable.
    * Circumstances have changed so significantly that the purpose has a completely different meaning from what the founder intended.
* **Founder's Reservation of Rights:** A founder can explicitly reserve the power to amend the foundation's purpose in the foundation deed. However, even with this right, the amendment must still align with the founder's presumed intent. If the founder is deceased or has not reserved this right, any changes are subject to the strict conditions above and are often supervised by the Liechtenstein Foundation Supervisory Authority (STIVA) or a court.

---

### **Norway** 🇳🇴

The Norwegian legal framework is designed to ensure foundations serve a long-term, specific purpose with strong public oversight.

* **Public Oversight:** The **Norwegian Gaming and Foundation Authority** (Stiftelsestilsynet) is the primary body responsible for regulating foundations. Any changes to a foundation's purpose must be approved by this authority. This oversight is the main measure to prevent a foundation from deviating from its original purpose.
* **Requirement for a Good Reason:** The foundation must have a valid reason for changing its purpose. Simply wanting to do something new is not enough. The Authority will only approve a change if it's determined to be in the best interests of the foundation and its original mission.
* **Public Register:** All Norwegian foundations are listed in a public register, and their purpose is clearly stated. This transparency allows for public scrutiny and acts as a deterrent against unauthorized changes.

---

### **South Korea** 🇰🇷

South Korea's system is highly regulated by the government, making it difficult to alter a foundation's purpose.

* **Government Approval:** Because a foundation's establishment requires permission from the competent government ministry, any change to its fundamental purpose or Articles of Incorporation also requires **government approval**. This is the single most important measure to prevent a purpose change.
* **Non-Profit Principle:** The purpose must remain non-profit and must fall within the scope of art, charity, science, or similar public-interest fields as defined in the Civil Act. A foundation would not be permitted to change its purpose to a purely commercial or private-benefit one.
* **Public Auditing:** Foundations are subject to continuous oversight and auditing by the supervising government agency, which ensures that their activities and assets are being used in accordance with their approved purpose. Any change without proper approval could lead to legal penalties or even dissolution.

---

### **United Kingdom** 🇬🇧

In the UK, the prevention of purpose change for a charity (the closest equivalent to a foundation) is handled by the **Charity Commission**.

* **Governing Document:** The charity's purpose is enshrined in its governing document, such as a trust deed or a company's Articles of Association. This is the foundational legal constraint on its activities.
* **Charity Commission Authority:** A charity must obtain the **authority of the Charity Commission** to change its purposes. The Commission will only grant this if it's convinced that the change is necessary and in the best interests of the charity.
* **The "Cy-près" Doctrine:** This is a crucial legal principle in the UK. If a charity's purpose becomes impossible or obsolete, the Commission can approve a purpose change that is **"as near as possible" (cy-près)** to the original intent. This prevents a complete change of direction and ensures that the founder's original charitable will is respected, even if its specific application is no longer feasible. 
* **Statutory Powers:** The **Charities Act 2022** introduced new provisions that give trustees more flexibility to make certain amendments, but fundamental changes to purpose still require the Commission's direct oversight and approval, which is a key safeguard.

## Prompt 10:

Does the government have power to change a foundation’s purpose?

## Answer 10:

Yes, in most cases, the government has the power to oversee and approve changes to a foundation's purpose, but it rarely has the power to change the purpose unilaterally. Instead, its role is to act as a **gatekeeper**, ensuring that any proposed change is legally sound and in the public interest, or at least in line with the founder's original intent.

***

### **Liechtenstein** 🇱🇮

In Liechtenstein, the government's power is more limited and often exercised by a court. The primary power to change a foundation's purpose lies with the **founder**, who can reserve this right. If the founder has not done so, the **Foundation Council** (board) or a court can only change the purpose if it has become **unachievable, impermissible, or irrational**. The **Liechtenstein Foundation Supervisory Authority (STIFA)** supervises these processes but does not have the power to change the purpose on its own.

***

### **Norway** 🇳🇴

The Norwegian government has significant power through the **Norwegian Gaming and Foundation Authority** (Stiftelsestilsynet). This authority must approve any changes to a foundation's purpose. The foundation's board must apply for the change and provide a valid reason, which the Authority will assess to ensure it's in the best interests of the foundation and its original mission. The government's role is to act as a public regulator, ensuring accountability and adherence to the law.

***

### **South Korea** 🇰🇷

South Korea's system gives the government the strongest direct power over foundation purpose. A foundation's articles of incorporation and any amendments, including changes to its purpose, must be **authorized by the relevant government ministry**. Without this explicit government permission, the change cannot be legally implemented. This is a key part of the government's strict oversight to ensure all foundations remain aligned with their non-profit, public-benefit missions.

***

### **United Kingdom** 🇬🇧

In the UK, the government's power is delegated to the **Charity Commission**. The commission has the authority to approve or deny proposed changes to a charity's purpose. Trustees must apply to the commission for permission to make such a change, which will only be granted if the commission determines it is in the best interests of the charity. The legal principle of **"cy-près"** ensures that if the original purpose becomes unachievable, the new purpose must be as close as possible to the founder's original intent. 

## Prompt 11:

What combination of foundation and cooperative forms of organisation in Norway or Lichtenstein would ensure the perpetual purpose of commercial activity for public good managed by a democratic governance structure?

## Answer 11:

In Norway, the combination of a **commercial foundation (erhvervsdrivende stiftelse)** and a **cooperative (samvirkeforetak)** would best achieve this.

This is the most effective structure for ensuring the perpetual purpose of commercial activity for public good managed by a democratic governance structure. The commercial foundation would hold the shares or membership interests of the cooperative. This foundation's articles of association would mandate that all or a significant portion of the profits from the cooperative's commercial activities must be used for a specific public good. For example, a foundation could own a cooperative that generates and distributes renewable energy, and its charter would require the profits to be used for climate change initiatives or local community development.

### Perpetuity
The **foundation** provides the perpetual purpose. It is a legal entity that does not have owners and is created to exist indefinitely for its stated purpose. Its purpose cannot be changed without approval from the Norwegian Foundation Authority, which ensures the mission remains intact for the long term. This prevents the commercial activity from being sold or redirected for private gain.

### Democratic Governance
The **cooperative** provides the democratic governance. Cooperatives are based on the principle of "one member, one vote," regardless of the amount of capital contributed. This structure allows the members to directly manage the commercial activity. The foundation, as the sole or a major member of the cooperative, would be the entity that casts a vote, but it can be required by its own charter to have its representative act on the collective will of the people it serves, or to have its board composed of democratic representatives from various stakeholders. 

***

### Liechtenstein 🇱🇮

In Liechtenstein, this combination is also possible, but it has different characteristics. The core structure would be similar: a **common-benefit foundation (Gemeinnützige Stiftung)** would own the shares of a **cooperative (Genossenschaft)**.

### Structure
The Liechtenstein foundation would serve the same perpetual purpose, dedicating the profits from the cooperative to a public good as outlined in its deed. However, the legal system and historical use of foundations in Liechtenstein lend a different flavor to this arrangement.

### Perpetuity
Liechtenstein foundations are renowned for their flexibility and perpetual nature. The purpose, once established, is difficult to change without the founder's initial consent or if the purpose becomes unattainable. The **Liechtenstein Foundation Supervisory Authority (STIFA)** oversees this to ensure the founder's intent is respected.

### Democratic Governance
While a cooperative is a legal form with democratic principles in Liechtenstein, the **governance of the foundation itself** is not inherently democratic. Foundation councils are typically appointed, not elected by a broad membership. To achieve a democratic governance structure, the foundation's deed would need to be carefully drafted to specify that its board includes representatives from the cooperative, beneficiaries, or other democratically elected individuals. This requires more deliberate legal structuring compared to the Norwegian model, where foundations and cooperatives are often a more natural pairing in their legal and cultural context.

## Prompt 12:

Can a foundation provide the context for open democratic membership in governance of commercial activities within a fixed boundary of public good and environmental principals so that entryism or degeneration of values could be prevented?

## Answer 12:

Yes, a foundation can provide the context for open, democratic governance of commercial activities while preventing the degeneration of values or "entryism." This is achieved through a carefully crafted legal and governance structure that combines the best features of foundations and other organizational forms.

### 1. The Foundation as the Purpose-Holder
The foundation's primary role is to act as the perpetual guardian of the organization's core values and purpose. It is legally bound to the public good and environmental principles, which are enshrined in its deed and statutes. This document is the ultimate legal defense against value erosion.

* **Perpetuity of Purpose:** The foundation's nature as an asset-holding entity without owners ensures its purpose is fixed and long-term. In countries like Norway, this purpose is protected by a government authority, making it extremely difficult to change. This prevents the organization from being sold off or its commercial activities being redirected for private gain.
* **Asset Lock:** The foundation's assets—including the commercial entity itself—are "locked." This means they cannot be distributed to private individuals or owners. All profits must be reinvested into the commercial activity or used to further the public good, as specified in the foundation's purpose.

***

### 2. Democratic Governance
The foundation can incorporate a democratic governance structure by holding the commercial activity through a separate legal entity, like a **cooperative**. The foundation would be a member of the cooperative, and its representative would sit on the cooperative's board.

* **Cooperative Principles:** Cooperatives, by their nature, are democratically governed. This typically involves a "one member, one vote" system. By making the foundation a member, it can ensure that the commercial activity is managed with democratic principles. The foundation's board could even be structured to include representatives from the cooperative's members, ensuring a direct link between the democratic body and the foundation's oversight.
* **Prevention of Entryism:** To prevent "entryism," where a small group infiltrates an organization to change its values, the foundation can set specific rules for cooperative membership and board representation. For instance, membership could require a long-term commitment, adherence to the foundation's values, or a demonstrated contribution to the public good. The foundation's ultimate veto power over major changes to the commercial activity or cooperative governance would serve as the final safeguard.

***

### 3. Measures to Prevent Value Degeneration
The foundation's legal and governance structure can incorporate specific measures to ensure that its public good mission remains a priority.

* **Value-Based Statutes:** The foundation's statutes can explicitly state the core values and public good principles that must guide all commercial decisions. This goes beyond a general purpose statement and creates a legal obligation for the board to act in a specific, value-driven way.
* **Independent Oversight:** The foundation's board could include an independent, non-elected body, such as an **advisory board or a council of elders**, with the power to review and challenge decisions that deviate from the core purpose. This body can be composed of respected experts in the relevant public good or environmental field.
* **Public Reporting:** The foundation can mandate a high level of transparency and public reporting on its commercial activities and how they align with its public good mission. This public accountability creates a strong external pressure to prevent any degeneration of values.

In this model, the **foundation** holds the long-term, non-negotiable **purpose**, while the **cooperative** provides the **democratic structure** for day-to-day management. This combination creates a powerful and resilient framework that is difficult to undermine.

## Prompt 13:

How is the composition of the foundation’s board determined?

## Answer 13:

The composition of a foundation's board is determined by its **governing document**, which is established by the founder or founders. While the founders have significant control, there are legal requirements and regulatory oversight in each country that dictate the minimum number of members and who can serve.

***

### **Liechtenstein** 🇱🇮
The board, known as the **Foundation Council**, is appointed by the founder in the foundation deed or a supplementary document.

* **Legal Requirements:** The law requires a minimum of two members on the Foundation Council. At least one of these members must be a **licensed trustee, lawyer, or accountant** residing in Liechtenstein or the European Economic Area (EEA). This ensures professional oversight and compliance with local laws.
* **Flexibility:** The founder can define the qualifications, roles, and terms of the board members. The deed can also establish other bodies, such as a protector or a family council, to oversee the board and ensure the founder's wishes are followed.

***

### **Norway** 🇳🇴
The board is appointed according to the foundation's statutes (articles of association).

* **Founder's Role:** The founder appoints the first board members when the foundation is established. The statutes then outline the process for appointing future board members.
* **Legal Requirements:** The **Norwegian Foundations Act** requires a foundation to have a board of directors with at least one **external member**. An "external member" is someone who is not the founder or closely associated with them, ensuring a degree of independence. The board must also have a chairperson.
* **Oversight:** The **Norwegian Gaming and Foundation Authority** ensures that the board composition and appointment process comply with the foundation's statutes and the law.

***

### **South Korea** 🇰🇷
The board of directors is determined by the foundation's **Articles of Incorporation**.

* **Founder's Role:** The founder specifies the composition and initial members of the board in the articles.
* **Legal Requirements:** South Korean law requires a foundation to have a board of directors, and the number of members and their qualifications must be clearly defined in the articles. The board is responsible for management and is subject to the strict oversight of the competent government ministry that granted the foundation's license.

***

### **United Kingdom** 🇬🇧
The composition of a charity's board of trustees is determined by its governing document (e.g., a trust deed or articles of association).

* **Founder's Role:** The founder appoints the initial trustees and lays out the rules for future appointments in the governing document. This document might specify the skills, expertise, or background of future trustees.
* **Flexibility:** There is no fixed legal requirement for the number of trustees, but the **Charity Commission** recommends a board of at least five. The governing document may specify if trustees are appointed, elected by members, or co-opted for specific skills.
* **Oversight:** The Charity Commission provides guidance on good governance, emphasizing the importance of diversity and relevant skills, but the ultimate decision rests with the charity's founders and its governing body.

## Prompt 14:

Could a cooperative found such a foundation to create this structure in Lichtenstein or Norway?

## Answer 14:

Yes, a cooperative can found a foundation in both Liechtenstein and Norway. The legal frameworks in both countries allow for a legal entity, such as a cooperative, to act as the founder of a foundation.

***

### **Norway** 🇳🇴
In Norway, a cooperative (samvirkeforetak) can legally establish a foundation (stiftelse). This is explicitly permitted under the Norwegian Foundations Act.

* **How it Works:** The cooperative's board or general assembly would make the decision to establish the foundation and transfer the initial capital. The cooperative would draft the foundation's statutes, which would define the foundation's purpose, its board composition, and how it will use the profits from its commercial activities. The Norwegian Foundation Authority would then review and approve the establishment of the foundation.
* **The Structure:** This structure is particularly effective for the purpose you described. The **cooperative** maintains its democratic governance and manages the commercial activity. The **foundation**, as the founder and potential owner of the cooperative's shares, ensures that the commercial activity's profits are dedicated to a perpetual public good mission. The cooperative remains the engine of the commercial activity, while the foundation is the guardian of the values and purpose.

***

### **Liechtenstein** 🇱🇮
In Liechtenstein, a cooperative (Genossenschaft) can also found a foundation (Stiftung).

* **How it Works:** The cooperative would establish the foundation through a legal declaration of establishment, endowing it with the initial capital. The cooperative, as the founder, would determine the foundation's purpose and its governance structure. This would be done through the foundation's deed and statutes.
* **The Structure:** This model also works well, with the **cooperative** engaging in commercial activity and the **foundation** holding the cooperative's assets and acting as the vehicle for the perpetual purpose. The key difference in Liechtenstein is the legal emphasis on the founder's will. The foundation's purpose would be irrevocably tied to the cooperative's founding intent, with any changes requiring strict legal oversight to ensure they are in line with that original will. This strong focus on the founder's intent provides a powerful tool for ensuring the long-term integrity of the mission.

## Prompt 15:

Could a cooperative in Korea found a foundation in Lichtenstein or Norway?

## Answer 15:

Yes, a cooperative in Korea can found a foundation in either Liechtenstein or Norway. In both countries, a legal entity, such as a cooperative, is allowed to be the founder of a foundation.

### Liechtenstein 🇱🇮

A South Korean cooperative can found a foundation in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein's legal framework is very flexible and allows for both natural persons and legal entities, regardless of their nationality or place of residence, to be founders.

* **Process:** The Korean cooperative would establish the foundation through a notarized declaration of establishment and by endowing the foundation with the minimum required capital. A Liechtenstein-based trustee or legal professional would typically handle the setup on behalf of the cooperative.
* **Legal Basis:** The **Persons and Companies Act (PGR)** in Liechtenstein provides the legal basis for this. It does not place restrictions on the domicile or legal form of the founder.
* **Advantage:** This is an ideal solution for a Korean cooperative looking to establish a separate legal entity with a defined purpose outside of Korea's strict regulatory environment for foundations.

### Norway 🇳🇴

A South Korean cooperative can also legally found a foundation in Norway. The Norwegian system explicitly permits this.

* **Process:** The Korean cooperative would draft the foundation's statutes and transfer the initial capital. The foundation would then be registered with the **Norwegian Gaming and Foundation Authority (Stiftelsestilsynet)**.
* **Legal Basis:** The **Norwegian Foundations Act** states that both natural persons and legal entities can be founders of a foundation. This includes foreign entities like a South Korean cooperative.
* **Advantage:** This allows a Korean cooperative to leverage Norway's robust legal framework, which is built on principles of transparency and public oversight. The foundation's purpose would be protected by a government agency, ensuring the long-term integrity of the mission.

## Prompt 16:

What other countries have similar legal frameworks for this relationship?

## Answer 16:

Other countries with legal frameworks that allow a foundation to own a for-profit business for a public good mission include **Denmark**, **Sweden**, **Germany**, and **Switzerland**. This type of ownership structure is particularly common in Nordic and German-speaking countries, where foundations are known as "enterprise foundations" or "steward-owned" companies. 

---

### **Denmark** 🇩🇰
Denmark is a leading example of this model. Enterprise foundations own a significant portion of Danish market capitalization. These foundations, known as **Erhvervsdrivende fonde**, are legally required to manage their commercial activities for a charitable purpose. The foundation is a separate legal entity, and its assets are locked for the public good, providing a permanent and stable ownership structure. Well-known examples include the **Novo Nordisk Foundation**, which owns pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk and uses the profits to support scientific and humanitarian causes. 

---

### **Germany** 🇩🇪
Germany's legal framework for foundations (Stiftungen) is similar to that of Liechtenstein and Norway. A German foundation can own a commercial company, but it must be for a non-profit purpose. The foundation must be registered and is subject to state-level regulatory oversight. The **Robert Bosch Stiftung**, which owns most of the shares in the Bosch Group, is a prominent example. The dividends from the company's profits fund the foundation's charitable work in health, science, and education.

---

### **Sweden** 🇸🇪
Sweden has a legal framework that allows for foundations to own and operate commercial businesses. The Swedish government has also promoted "steward ownership" models, where companies are held in a foundation-like structure to ensure long-term purpose over short-term profit. The **IKEA Foundation**, which owns the IKEA brand, is one of the most well-known examples of this model. The foundation's profits are used for charitable purposes.

---

### **Switzerland** 🇨🇭
Switzerland has a flexible and well-developed legal system for foundations (Stiftungen). Foundations can be established to hold commercial assets, but they are subject to regulation by the federal or cantonal supervisory authorities. The **Carl Zeiss Foundation** is a classic example. It owns two major companies, Carl Zeiss AG and Schott AG, and dedicates its profits to promoting science and technology.
