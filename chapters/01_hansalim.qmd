In 1986 pro-democracy protesters were out in the streets fighting with police and trying to escape tear gas.[^herald]
Since seizing power in a military coup in 1961, General Park Chung-hee presided over 18 years of military rule.
Following his assassination in 1979 and another coup, General Chun Doo-hwan installed himself as president, leading what was essentially a continuation of the military regime in the face of growing mass protests calling for democratic government.[^hwang]

In the midst of such turmoil, a small group of farmers and housewives opened a small rice store in the centre of Seoul.
In light of the chaotic political situation, this looked like a foolish and insignificant action.
However, the creation of that first store, called Hansalim Nongsan, was actually a radical act of resistance and hope in the face of political uncertainty.
The men and women who opened Hansalim Nongsan belonged to a small cooperative of producers and consumers in a city called Wonju, about an hour away from Seoul, and that store represented a first step in launching an ecological alternative movement that had been gathering support in Wonju and beyond since the late 1970s.
It's founders where known as the Wonju Group.

## A movement, a manifesto, a business

The Wonju Group were a diverse collection of Catholic Farmers, urban housewives, pro-democracy activists, artists, poets and scholars who had been involved in the credit union movement in Wonju that was founded in the 1960s.
They had witnessed the fundamentally destructive tendencies of capitalist and socialist industrialisation and they were looking for an alternative in the cooperative movement.
However, they recognised that cooperatives were also vulnerable to the same fundamental mistake that lay at the heart of industrial civilization.
That mistake was to assume a materialist, mechanistic view of the world which viewed humans and all life as replaceable parts in the machine of economic growth.
It was this worldview, they argued, that gave rise to the characteristics of domination, alienation, separation and oppression in modern society.

![The Wonju Group with the Hansalim Gathering (1989)](../images/chapter_01/Hansalim-Moim.jpeg)

As an alternative, they proposed a worldview founded on the sacredness and interconnectedness of all life.
The first version of this worldview or eco-philosophy was outlined in the Wonju Report in 1982.
As the movement began to grow the Wonju Group set up the first Life Cooperative in Wonju in 1985 and the Hansalim Nongsan rice store a year later.[^h2017]
In this way, the Wonju Coop formally brought together organic farming and direct trade with the equal participation of consumers and producers.

[^h2017]: Hansalim. 2017. “Because of you we live: Hansalim 30th Anniversary White Paper.” Seoul, Korea: Hansalim.

::: {layout="[70,30]"}

Soon after, the Hansalim Community Consumers Union was set-up in Seoul with 70 members to trade directly with the Hansalim Producers Association that was set up with 70 farming households.
Next, the Wonju Group hosted a year long process of study and discussion to develop the Hansalim Manifesto which was published in 1989 and which formally launched the Hansalim Life Movement.
From this small beginning, the movement quickly expanded as other cooperatives and farming communities joined from across the country and consumer membership grew.

![The Hansalim Manifesto, English version](../images/chapter_01/Hansalim-Manifesto.jpeg){width="" fig-align="left"}

:::

By 1990 there were four Life Cooperatives with over 5,500 members and within just over another 10 years membership had grown to over 40,000.
That is when things really began to take off and by 2008 there were 19 Life Cooperatives managing 84 stores for their 170,000 members.
In 2023 Hansalim's 27 Life Cooperatives and 15 Producer Federations handled annual sales of 485,066 million KRW (324.3 million euros) through 240 stores, an online store and a mobile app.[^h2024]
From these sales, 330,610 million KRW (221 million euros) were returned to the 136 producer communities.
That is nearly 70%!
So what kind of business model has Hansalim created that provides those returns to producers while covering the shared business operations and funding a whole range of movement activities from the remaining 30%?
And what lies at the heart of this unusual way of doing business?

(Graph of growth)

## Built on a relationship of mutual care

At its simplest, the Hansalim Life Movement is a relationship of mutual care and responsibility between rural and urban communities.
The core of Hansalim's approach is expressed in this phrase: “Let the producer take responsibility for sustaining the consumer's life and the consumer for sustaining the producer's livelihood”.[^h2021]
However, this mutual responsibility is about much more than simply direct sales as it also encompasses a shared commitment to protecting and restoring ecosystems and working for wider social and cultural change towards justice and peace.

[^h2021]: see for example Hansalim. 2021. “Hansalim Annual Report 2021.” Seoul, Korea: Hansalim.

This expansive goal is captured by the name itself: “Hansalim” (한살림).

The first part of the word, 'Han' (한) contains two sets of paradoxical meanings.
It expresses, firstly, a paradoxical double sense of being collectively one and  individually one and, secondly, of spreading out as one and gathering in as one.[^manifesto]
In ancient Korean philosophy 'Han' refers to the divine Spirit or life of the universe which permeates all things living and inanimate and integrates the universe into an evolving cosmos.

[^manifesto]: Hansalim. 2021. Hansalim Manifesto (English Version). Mosim and Salim Research Institute.

The word 'Salim' (살림) has two related meanings.
The first is 'housekeeping' which implies parental care, homemaking, food preparation, hospitality.
It is perhaps the most practical of all human activities and is the bedrock of human survival and flourishing.
The second meaning develops from this practical sense the philosophical concept of 'nurturing' which has the connotation of saving and restoring, bringing back to life, vivifying.[^mosim3]

[^mosim3]: Yoon, Hyunggeun, ed. 2004. Salim's Words. Mosim and Salim, Book 3. Seoul: Mosim and Salim Research Institute.

So we see that the word 'Hansalim' expresses a relationship and an action. 
It encompasses the goal of nurturing or reviving all things, that is bringing all into a flourishing shared life together.
In fact, the word 'Hansalim' is often used as a verb as when members encourage each other by saying "let's Hansalim!"

Among Hansalim members, the word “Salim” is used to express their purpose in all their activities.
So the collective mission of Hansalim is summed up in four phrases that each incorporate this word Salim.

The first, 'Nurturing Food' (밥상살림 — bapsang-salim) refers to the goal of providing consumers with safe, healthy, eco-friendly food and other household goods and this defines the responsibility that producers adopt for the life of consumers. 
The word in Korean directly translates as nurturing the dining table and the significance of this is that it refers to the act of sharing a meal, not simply consuming food.
Second, 'Nurturing Agriculture' (농업살림 — nongup-salim) refers to the goal of securing stable and sustainable livelihoods for producers and this defines the responsibility which consumers adopt for the livelihoods of producers.
Third, 'Nurturing Life' (생명살림 — saengmyeong-salim) expresses the responsibility of care for others (human and non-human) which producers and consumers together share and which is worked out through outward focused activities such as promoting eco-friendly farming, environmental campaigning, education, social welfare projects, and inward contemplative and reflective practices.
Finally, 'Nurturing Community' (지역살림 — jiyeok-salim), emphasises the need to strengthen local community resources and relationships and to reach out to neighbours in need.

So how are these values put into practice? I'm going to tackle this question from bottom up, first from the rural or producer perspective and then from the urban or consumer perspective before describing the alternative economic system that brings them together.

## In the form of a multistakeholder cooperative

The producer community is the smallest level of organization in Hansalim.
In these communities farming is done together by a group of family farms who partner with one another to plan and coordinate their production, share knowledge and labour, and manage shared facilities and equipment.
To join Hansalim as a producer, you would join one of these communities and receive training in eco-friendly farming and Hansalim's production and processing standards.

There are 136 producer communities which cultivate a total of 11,300 acres.
In addition to the producer communities there are 110 processing units which process raw materials from Hansalim's producers as well as seafood and other products from local organic and environmentally friendly sources.[^h2024]
The producer organizations are brought together into 15 regional federations with their own elected representatives which together form Hansalim's National Producer Federation with their own elected president and employed staff.
Many of these regional federations pool resources to run local distribution hubs with their own processing facilities and some have created complex systems to process and re-circulate farm wastes as inputs between multiple local farms.

:::

When you join Hansalim as a consumer you become a member of your local Life Cooperative (one among 27 as of 2024).
The word “Life” is significant because these cooperatives are not like the conventional consumer cooperatives that you would encounter in Europe or America.
Their focus is not only responsible consumption but also seeking to live together in solidarity with one another and with producers and rural communities.
Each Life Cooperative in Hansalim is a democratic autonomous organization formed by members to carry out collective activities, set-up and run Hansalim stores, organize charitable, cultural and educational activities and the joint activities between rural producers and urban consumers.

:::

Together, the producer communities and federations and the Life Coops form a federation of cooperatives, associations and businesses linked together through a shared business federation and the Hansalim Federation with its support organisations including a research institute, charitable foundation, solar power coop, publishing house, training institute and peer-to-peer finance platform.
So how does this business work?

## Creating an alternative economy

In simple terms, the Hansalim business model can be described as a contract-based direct sales arrangement in which prices and quantities are agreed annually in advance by producers and consumers with support from Hansalim's professional staff.
However, it is also very flexible in ways that are designed to support the needs of producers.

### A system designed for producers {.unnumbered}

There are four key features of Hansalim's business model.
Firstly: flexibility of production.
Hansalim's production system allows for a relatively wide range of production philosophies and techniques among member producers to ensure that producers have maximum autonomy.
For example, one producer community might prefer a relatively simple style of organic farming with a small number of crops while another aspires to build a complex system of circulating agriculture with a large diversity of crops and livestock supported by recycling of farm wastes from one part of the system as inputs to others.
Still others, especially fruit producers, might find it impossible to grow without a limited use of safe pesticides.
A dogmatic insistence on a single farming philosophy would exclude many farmers who might be unable to follow a one-size-fits-all system in the face of local conditions or other resource constraints.
Hansalim's more flexible approach removes a significant barrier to entry for farmers who would otherwise need to spend a long time learning new techniques before starting to earn an income.
This brings the added advantage that farmers who want to transition from conventional to organic farming can do so in a staged process while still making a living.
However, it also creates a problem. How to maintain the trust of consumers when the diversity of production techniques is so wide?

This brings us to the second feature of Hansalim's business model: simple and honest labeling.
Transparency with consumer members is ensured through Hansalim's own labelling system.
Products are labelled under four main categories:

1. Organic (which would include conventional organic, permaculture and EM techniques);
2. Pesticide-free (when crop types and local conditions make it non-viable to exclude use of fertilizers);
3. Low pesticide (for certain fruit crops which would be prohibitively difficult to grow without a limited use of pesticides);
4. Domestic (for miscellaneous grains such as wheat or barley which are used as raw ingredients in some processed goods).

For all four categories Hansalim's standards are stricter than the national safety standards and products are tested regularly for residues, contaminants and radiation as appropriate to protect trust between consumers and producers.

To complement the flexibility and transparency of production methods the third feature - flexibility of supply - enhances the autonomy of producers and provides some added resilience to the system.
Hansalim producers are not locked-in to exclusive supply contracts but have the freedom to supply whatever proportion of their crop to Hansalim they wish while simultaneously supplying through other channels such as government purchasing schemes for school meals.
This applies to each producer community and also to each member of each community.
So one farmer might supply 30% of their produce to Hansalim through their community while selling the rest through local government procurement for school meals.
Or a producer community might sell Hansalim branded grapes through the Hansalim Federation while selling grape juice through another market under their own brand.

Finally, for an additional level of flexibility, the contract-based system is supplemented by demand-based supply arrangements to allow greater flexibility for producers.

Taken together, these four features of Hansalim's business model mean that, within and between producer communities the level of specialization or circular integration and the combination of sales channels are all decided by the producers themselves.
This makes for an astonishingly diverse range of production operations each tailored to the local soil and climate conditions and preferences of producers themselves, while ensuring a stable guaranteed income to as many farmers as possible.

These images show just a tiny snapshot of some of the different farming landscapes, crops and approaches which form Hansalim's complex agricultural systems.
The system of labelling helps provide a sense of order to this complexity for the sake of Hansalim's consumer members and also facilitates the progression of Hansalim producers further away from conventional farming methods towards progressively more eco-friendly alternatives.
Let's look at the overall share of production according to production type, crop type and supply type.
The following graph, @fig-productionflow, shows the flow of goods by tons.

:::: {#fig-productionflow}

Flow of production quantities by type, crop and contract in 2023 (tons).
::::

On the left you can see the four labelled production types of ***organic***, ***pesticide-free***, ***low-pesticide*** and ***domestic***.
In the centre, the crop types are divided into ***vegetables***, ***staple grains***, ***roots and tubers***, ***fruit***, and ***miscellaneous grains***.
On the right, crop types are categorized into supply type as either ***contract-based*** or ***demand-based*** supply.
[If you interact with the graph you can see the number of tons of each combination.]{.content-visible when-format="html"}
The majority of production is organic and this accounts for most of the vegetable cultivation, almost all staple grains and root and tubers.
These crop types are almost entirely supplied on a contract-basis.
Pesticide-free production accounts for some vegetable supply, a fraction of staple grains and some fruit crops.
It is in fruit cultivation that higher proportion of crops are cultivated according to 'low-pesticide' standards.
This is because many fruit crops are especially vulnerable to pests and would no be viable for producers without some use of non-synthetic pesticides.
Miscellaneous grains are mostly produced under the domestic label and supplied on a demand-basis.

So what happens to the revenue from these sales?
As I mentioned above, until recently, with margins well below 30%, Hansalim was able to return 73% or more of the product price to the producers.
Now, following several years of rising costs and worsening impacts of climate change the margin has come under increasing pressure and currently stands at just over 31% which leaves almost 69% for producers.
This table in @fig-margin shows the breakdown of what the margin covers.

The breakdown of Hansalim's margin in 2023.

That is virtually the reverse of conventional market distribution which usually takes a 50 - 70% margin.
So what does this distribution of revenue look like from the point of view of the Life Coops, producers and the federal organisations?
The following chart, @fig-valueflow, shows the flow of value (in euros) from the sales of goods (on the left) through each Life Coop (center) to the share of revenue provided to each category of organization (right).

:::: {#fig-valueflow}

:::

Flow of value from sales revenue through each Life Coop to other organizations (euros).
::::

You will notice that the vast majority of sales are of 'federation goods' which are those supplied through the business federation's distribution channels.
A much smaller percentage of sales are accounted for by so-called 'local goods' which are supplied independently from Hansalim's central distribution system.
The central column of the chart looks a bit messy, but the point is that the majority of sales are through shops managed by the Life Coops in Seoul and Gyeonggi (the province surrounding Seoul) which together form the largest and densest population centre in Korea.
On the right hand side you can see that the share of revenue returned to producers is by far the largest, while the margin covers the budgets of the Life Coops and finally the Business Federation and the Hansalim Federation.

This distribution revenue is achieved through a combination of:

1. Recovered costs from distribution by removing the multiple opportunities from profit gauging by intermediaries;
2. Prices set to reflect the true costs of production; and
3. Economies of scope and scale achieved through shared business activities and collectively owned capital at local, regional and national levels.

After providing for producers' livelihoods, what then does the remaining 30% pay for?

### A different kind of consumer experience {.unnumbered}

The largest portion (21.7%) goes to the Life Coops themselves to cover the costs of running stores, handling local distribution and their various educational, participation and engagement activities.
Life Coops are autonomous member owned businesses which run the Hansalim stores in their local areas.
They decide when and where to open new stores, how to manage them and how to organize local distribution options such as home delivery.
Stores are usually run by an employed manager and the Life Coop's Store Activists (consumer members who are trained and paid to staff the stores) and products are ordered through the Hansalim Business Federation and delivered from their national logistics centre.

In a Hansalim store you can buy virtually everything you need from food to household goods and even cosmetics.
Almost all these products are made by Hansalim producers and processors with a few exceptions for some household items and a handful of fair trade products.
Hansalim branded sales through the business federation are supplemented by local goods sourced by each store according to the decision of each Life Coop.
What this means is that there is usually just one type of everything you need rather than multiple brands of the same product so the shop size is relatively small compared to a regular supermarket.
Here are a few examples of the products that are available in my local Hansalim store.

Hansalim stores also differ from a conventional supermarket in another way.
They often provide the venue for member activities and encounters between consumers and producers facilitated by the Life Coop's Organizing Activists (members who are trained and paid to organize opportunities for consumers and producers to meet each other and share food and other activities together).
From the beginning of Hansalim, relationship building among consumers and between consumers and producers has been a top priority.

![An activity room inside a Hansalim Store showing the small kitchen, library and meeting space](../images/chapter_01/Hansalim-Store-Activity-Room.jpeg){group="stores"}

There are various ways consumers can build community together and participate in the livelihoods of producers.
Neighbourhood meetings and small groups provide a context for consumer members to learn and build relationships through reading groups, cooking classes, social activities, and environmental activism etc.
'Helping hands' visits are organized by Activists to bring members to help producers with farming activities such as planting, weeding and harvest and to join in with traditional rural rituals and share meals together.
Community work is also an important shared activity in which members and producers raise money for charitable causes, donate food to people in need and provide education and support to marginalized groups.
Consumers often visit the producer communities for local festivals or just to see the farm, share a meal and get to know each other.
Producers also visit stores to introduce their new products and many develop special relationships with particular Life Coops as well as participating in Hansalim conferences and multistakeholder committees.

Each of these activities are supported by funds allocated in the budgets of the Life Coops and the Hansalim Federation which ultimately come from their combined sales.
The chart below, @fig-participation, gives you an idea of the amount of interaction between consumers and producers in the course of a single year.
It shows the number of 'person-visits' categorized by each Life Coop and by the type of activity in 2023.
*Exchange* refers to activities involving interaction between producers and consumers and *engagement* refers to activities among consumers themselves.
You can see that there were around 59,000 encounters between individuals in 2023 that were directly facilitated by Hansalim’s member Life Coops.
Although many of these are repeat visits of individuals (so the total number of people involved will be somewhat less) you still get a sense of the sheer scale of relationship building that is going on within Hansalim.

Participation in 2023: engagement among consumers and exchanges between consumers and producers.

In addition to selling to members and organizing member activities, Life Coops also engage with the wider community by running a whole range of educational activities and training, community kitchens, environmental campaigns and community building activities and some have also set up new cooperatives in solar power and in the care sector.
On top of all these activities, the high point of Hansalim's cultural life are the festivals which are held at national and local levels.
For example, the Autumn festivals bring producers and consumers together for food, drinking and traditional games and dancing.
They provide a special context for making friends and creating a sense of shared identity and camaraderie.

For consumers and producers then, there is a lot of fun to be had as a member of a Hansalim community.
This is a vitally important part of the rhythm of hard work broken up by fantastic celebrations and informal contexts for relaxation together.
None of this would be possible, however, without the hard and often hidden work of the Practitioners.

### The special role of practitioners {.unnumbered}

In Hansalim, employees are referred to as 'practitioners.'
They are the people who make it possible to put the producer-consumer relationship into practice by running the businesses, coordinating movement activities and organizing the many processes that are required to keep each member organization running and working together as a federation. 
They are not only professionals in logistics, marketing, strategy etc. but they also act as mediators between consumer and producer members and their organizations.
Whereas a manager in a corporate enterprise might be able to focus solely on negotiating financial dealings with clients and suppliers, Hansalim practitioners often find themselves also negotiating the complex conflicts in values and expectations between Hansalim members, making their role especially difficult and important.

The largest employer of practitioners within Hansalim is the Business Federation which takes the next largest share of revenue after the Life Coops (8.86%) to cover the costs of labour, logistics, promotion and marketing, product development etc.
One of the most important asset managed by the business federation is the Anseong Logistics Centre.

![Hansalim's Anseong logistics and processing centre](../images/chapter_01/Logistics-Anseong.jpeg)

Finally, the smallest share of the margin (0.81%) is used to fund the Hansalim Federation which organizes the national-level governance and policy-making processes, supports Hansalim's educational, cultural, publishing, research and charitable activities, coordinates collaboration and solidarity activities with others in Korea and abroad, and provides support to the member Life Coops.

In 2023 there were a total of 291 practitioners working in the member Life Coops, a further 235 working for the Business Federation and 40 at the Hansalim Federation.
These were supplemented by 1,396 Activists working in the stores and to organize member activities.
Together with the 3,579 producers and processors they generate enough revenue to support themselves and the broader collective efforts of the Hansalim Life Movement to bring about social and cultural change towards a more sustainable way of living.

With such a large and complex organisation, you might think that there must be some strong central authority controlling everything from the top down and making sure efficiency is maximised and operations meticulously coordinated.
Happily (or perhaps sadly, depending on your point of view) that is not the case in Hansalim.

## Governed through deliberative democracy

One of the most extraordinary features of Hansalim is the depth of their commitment to deliberative democracy and local autonomy.
This emphasis on democracy has deep roots.
These roots traverse Korea's pro-democracy movement during the 1960s and 70s (in which many of the Hansalim founders were involved[^kim2019-dd]), the independence movement during Japanese colonial rule from 1910-1945[^kim2017] and finally also in Korea's traditional rural institutions known as Dure (farmers village cooperatives) and Gye (village credit unions) which existed during the Joseon dynasty prior to the colonial era and which probably originated even earlier in Korea's ancient past.[^lee2006]
A bit of history is in order to help understand the significance of democracy in Hansalim (see @fig-timeline).

### Rooted in history {.unnumbered}

This part of the story starts in 1919 with the March First Movement and the struggle for independence against Japanese colonial rule.
As part of this movement the first credit union was established in April 1919, the Kangkye Public Co-operative.[^kangye]
Soon, similar cooperatives were established among housewives, students, workers, and farmers to promote the economic independence of Koreans from colonial domination.
By 1938 there were more than 500 cooperatives with at least 140,000 members which helped to support the livelihoods of the poor and provide education to preserve the Korean language and cultural identity.[^kim2022]

Timeline of Korean history and evolution of the cooperative movement
:::

From the 1950s onwards, following the Korean war, grassroots cooperatives that had emerged as part of the anti-colonial independence movement in the 1920s and 30s began to re-form.
At the same time the state adopted the colonial era apparatus of cooperatives created by the Japanese to control the rural and industrial economy.
Park Chung-hee united the agricultural and financial cooperatives created by the colonial government to form the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF or Nonghyup) which now boasts of being one of the worlds’ largest agricultural cooperatives.
Although it is called a cooperative, it functioned as a para-state organisation and was used as a bureaucratic tool of state control to drive through the green revolution in agriculture and to manipulate political support for the Park regime among the rural population.[^nonghyup]

[^nonghyup]: Burmeister, Larry L. 2006. “Agricultural Cooperative Development and Change: A Window on South Korea’s Agrarian Transformation.” In Transformations in Twentieth Century Korea, edited by Yun-Shik Chang and Steven Hugh Lee, 78–100. Routledge Advances in Korean Studies. Routledge.

In contrast, closely connected to the emerging anti-Park democratisation movement, grassroots cooperatives started to spread again and to promote cooperative ideas throughout the country, establishing schools, consumer cooperatives, credit unions, and medical cooperatives to respond to the desperate need for affordable medical treatment for survivors of the war.[^kim2017]
The organic farming movement also began to spread through the influence of the Poolmoo school (now known as Poolmoowon) which established the first consumer cooperative in 1959 in South Chungcheong Province and, starting in 1975, developed the largest organic farming region in Korea.
Through the 1970s and early 1980s, the pro-democracy Catholic Farmers Movement, Catholic Priests' Association for Justice (CPAJ) and other Christian groups, credit unions and consumer cooperatives along with democratic movements among factory workers, peasant farmers, and students continued to increase in influence and spread throughout the country.

Among the leaders of this movement was the Catholic Bishop Ji Hak-soon, who became the first bishop of Wonju in 1965.
He had left North Korea before the war to train as priest in Rome and, while there, he was deeply impacted by the spirit of the Vatican Two Council which urged the church to become more outward focused on the needs of local communities and to support ecumenical unity; to become a church run by and for the people, and for the poor and marginalised in particular.[^kim2019-dh]

[^kim2019-dh]: Kim, So-Nam. 2019. “Cooperative and Life Movements in Wonju.” In 100 Years of the Korean Co-Operative Movement Vol. 1, edited by Seong-Bu Kim, Kim Chang-jin, Kim Ki-tae, Kim Hyeong-mi, Pak Bong-hui, Yeom Chan-hui, Yi Kyeong-ran, Jeong Kyu-ho, Lim Chae-do, and Han Seong-hoon, 253–85. Seoul, Korea: Autumn Morning.

It was in Wonju, that Ji Hak-soon met Jang Il-soon who was to become one of his closest friends.
Jang Il-soon was a native of Wonju and quit Seoul National University (SNU) after the war to found Daeseong School in Wonju to provide a free education to local children.
After a failed attempt to run for political office, he spent three years in prison between 1961 and 63, originally facing a death sentence, accused of being a communist.
After his sentence was commuted and he was released the state put him under surveillance and prohibited him from public lecturing or writing.
With no other options, he became a farmer and an artist, painting calligraphy which he gave away to everyone and anyone.
Within the context of the church, Ji Hak-soon gave him the opportunity to teach again and, in 1967, he began training lay Catholic members to prepare for a transformation of the church into a self-reliant lay-centred organisation that supported a wider rural development movement of credit unions and cooperatives.[^kim2019-dd-133]

[^kim2019-dd-133]: Kim, Sam-Woong. 2019. Biography of Jang Il-soon: The Beautiful Life of Muwidang. Edited by Muwidang People. Seoul, Korea: Dure. p. 133.

With a population of just 100,000, Wonju diocese was an impoverished region of coal-mining and farming communities.
The church was dependent upon foreign aid for its survival and the town itself was a cultural backwater with very few resources.
As soon as Ji Hak-soon took office he and Jang Il-soon set up Wonju's first credit union in 1966 and founded Jinkwang Middle School in 1967.
Jang Il-soon began to organise training courses for cooperative and credit union members and established the Cooperative Education Institute in Jinkwang school to develop the cooperative movement beyond the Catholic Church.[^Kim2019-dh]
The school's students and teachers also created the first school cooperative in Korea, Jinkwang Cooperative, to purchase books and equipment and run the canteen.

One of the teachers at the school was Park Jae-il.
In 1969, after his after his release from prison for his involvement in the June 3rd Movement (protests against the military regime's policy toward Japan) he moved to Wonju to join the Social Development Committee and the Catholic Farmers' Association, led by Bishop Ji Hak-soon.
He became a teacher at Jinkwang School and attended one of Jang Il-soon's lectures after school one day.
He was so captivated by the vision for reviving cooperation among the common people that he quit teaching to join the cooperative movement full time, taking up a key role in the Cooperative Education Institute.
From that moment he became a lifelong student of Jang Il-soon and worked alongside him and Bishop Ji Hak-soon in the cooperative and rural development movement in Wonju.
He would later become the president of the Catholic Farmers Association and then Hansalim's first chair of directors.

In addition to promoting education Ji Hak-soon also built cultural spaces, hospitals and welfare facilities for the disabled.
Among these projects, the most significant was the cultural centre which he built in front of Wonju Cathedral.
Sponsored by religious organisations from Europe and the United States and dedicated on July 12th 1968, the Wonju Catholic Center was the first civic cultural centre of the Korean Catholic Church.
The three story building -- run by the diocese and staffed by young lay church members -- included offices, meeting rooms, an exhibition hall, projection room, first-floor cafeteria, basement room and dormitories.
It quickly became a popular meeting place for young people and a hive of creative activity, hosting performances by local musicians and exhibitions by local artists.
The main hall was used to stage plays by Wonju's Sanya Theatre Company directed by Jang Il-soon's younger brother Jang Sang-soon and the basement room was the venue for DJs to play pop and classical music from a record collection which apparently exceeded even that of the local radio station!

Around the Bishop, Jang Il-soon, Park Jae-il and their friends, an informal network of pro-democracy and cooperative movement activists began to gather.
The Wonju Group, as they were known, began to expand the cooperative movement beyond Wonju into Gangwon province and to forge links across religious and ideological divides.
Both Jang Il-soon and Ji Hak-soon made a point of reaching out beyond the boundaries of the Catholic church to other religious groups, not only to other Christian dominations but also to Buddhists.
Priests, pastors and monks would visit each others congregations to preach and meet regularly at restaurants to share meals and talk together.
The Catholic Church in Wonju became a church not only for believers but for all people striving to build a better and more democratic society.
Following the example of Jesus, they sought to serve those in need without distinction and to freely support all who worked for the good of the whole community.[^personal]

[^personal]: Personal communication from a relative of a Wonju Hansalim founder.

Jang Il-soon saw the cooperative movement as a training ground for democracy for the whole community and a means of empowering people to become responsible citizens.[^kim2019-dd-152]
He described it as a "movement for service to the masses, abandoning arrogance and radical elite consciousness." and a "downward crawling movement."[^kim2019-dd-135]
In his lectures, Jang Il-soon reminded people of their own traditional culture of rural cooperation in Korea through Dure (farmers coops), Gye (village credit unions) and Pumasi (informal labour exchange).
He referenced the 19th century history of cooperation in the British working class (the Rochdale Pioneers) and the credit union movements in France and Germany as examples of people finding ways to break free from corporate exploitation and live together on their own terms through mutual aid and self-reliance.[^kim2019-dd-136]
He drew inspiration not only from Jesus's teachings but also from Buddhist scriptures, Daoist and Confucian philosophy and Ghandi's example of non-violent resistance to enlarge people's awareness of themselves and the world.

As a symbol of this broad and inclusive vision, the Wonju Catholic Centre became a hub for students and other pro-democracy activists and writers who gathered from Wonju and beyond to talk and drink late into the evenings in the cosy basement room.
One of those young people was a poet named Kim Young-il who wrote under the pen name "Ji-ha" (芝河).
Originally from Mokpo, Kim Ji-ha had moved as a child to Wonju with his parents.
At Seoul National University he became active within the pro-democracy movement in Seoul and, when he returned to Wonju, he brought with him a cast of activists and artists who quickly joined forces with the growing cultural movement (minjung movement) in Wonju.
Together they created yard plays (a form of traditional peasant theatre called madang-geuk, 마당극), troupe dances and plays for theatre.
These plays raised the profile of Wonju among the wider national minjung movement and before long, Wonju was being called "the holy land of democratisation."[^kim2019-dd-165]

Together, with the Wonju Group, Jang Il-soon and Ji Hak-soon reorganised the church in the Wonju diocese into a network of self-governing self-supporting parishes and set up a program of education and training aimed at empowering the poor and marginalised to form self-sufficient self-governing communities across Gangwon province.
Their vision was for a cooperative movement that was economically and politically independent from the authoritarian state and which promoted rural and urban development led by communities themselves.

However, just as things were starting to take off catastrophe hit.
In 1972 the large-scale flooding of the Namhan River basin caused widespread devastation in Gangwon and surrounding provinces.
In Wonju Diocese the floods damaged 50,000 buildings[^kim2019-dd] and displaced 100,000 people.[^kim2019-dh]
Bishop Ji Hak-soon went to Germany to ask for funds from the catholic charities Miserere and Caritas to support rebuilding.
With the money they provided (2.91 million marks or around $360,000) he set up a Disaster Countermeasures Project Committee to coordinate a long-term recovery project.
Instead of simply providing unconditional aid, as was normally done under such circumstances, the committee targeted their resources at supporting communities to become self-sufficient.
Food and money were given as wages for productive work rebuilding communities, restoring farmland and developing new income sources for farmers such as setting up craft workshops.

 focused on training and the creation of local consumer and producer cooperatives led by villagers themselves to create self-sufficient communities governed through local democracy.

The recovery project began in 1973 as Jang Il-soon 
Jang Il-soon and the other Wonju Group members lead the rural development and education initiative.
The rural development program of the Disaster Countermeasures Project Committee and its successor organisation, the Social Development Committee, established 74 credit unions in rural areas and mining villages
By 1977, the cooperative movement had

A bit more detail about the Disaster Recovery Committee... and the democratising influence of it on Wonju, Gangwon province and beyond.

Something about their reflections on the 70s and experience with the disaster recovery and new directions when Kim Ji-ha came out of prison.

However, despite the success of the flood recovery project, they had become discouraged by the failure of the movement to halt the destructive progress of industrialisation.
They were also worried by the rise of militant marxism among the vanguard of the democracy movement which was becoming increasingly violent.
They had hoped for an alternative to the fundamentally destructive tendencies of capitalist and socialist industrialisation in the cooperative movement but they began to recognise that cooperatives were also vulnerable to same fundamental problem that lay at the heart of industrial civilisation.
That problem was a materialist, mechanistic view of the world which viewed humans and all life as replaceable parts in the machine of economic growth.
It was this worldview that gave rise to the characteristics of domination, alienation, separation and oppression in modern society.

When preparing to launch a new kind of cooperative movement, the Life Movement, the Hansalim founders drew on their own long experience of cooperation in Wonju and also studied the experience of other movements around the world.
They took note of the cautionary tales democratic decline among the western cooperative movement and their own past struggles to mobilise members and manage participation.


==Currently, 150,000 people, or 44% of Wonju's population of 360,000, are credit union members (141). The credit union has accumulated more than 1 trillion won in assets, contributing significantly to the development of the community.==[Jang Il-soon bio]


### Subsidiarity {.unnumbered}

Below, @fig-federation, is a diagram of Hansalim's various organizations as they existed in 2023 and how they related to each other, laid out in order of how authority is delegated from top to bottom.
At the top are the individual members. The 890,000 Member households and the 3,579 Producers.
They are the owners of Hansalim.
Below you can see the Life Coops, Producer Organizations and the Support Organizations and in the box labelled 'Member Organisations Autonomous Activities' I have listed the numbers of people involved (as far as data is available).
The word 'Practitioner' here is Hansalim's term for employed staff member (as mentioned above).
Remember that 'Activists' refers to consumer members paid to either organise producer-consumer activities or work in the stores.
Between them, the member organisations elect a total of 212 delegates to the General Assembly of the Hansalim Federation (maximum two 1-year terms).
The General Assembly elects a board of 36 directors including the chair of directors who holds the title of president (maximum two 2-year terms).
The board appoints the executive directors of the Federation, the Business Federation and the support organizations but cannot interfere with the governance and management of the member Life Coops or producer organizations.
The standing committees, conferences and steering committees are where deliberations take place over policy and strategy decisions and they operate at local and national level involving producers, members and practitioners.

Hansalim's many organisations and their relationships.
:::

So you see that neither the Hansalim Federation nor the Business Federation are 'apex' organisations or 'head offices' but rather, they are supporting organisations whose purpose is to facilitate the successful business of the Life Coops and producer organisations while running the delegated shared movement activities and supporting the independent movement activities of member organisations.

### Mutual responsibilities {.unnumbered}

The way the Hansalim Federation sees itself in relation to the other Hansalim organisations can be understood with the help of the following diagram, @fig-stakeholders, which was published in the Hansalim 2017 White Paper.[^h2017]
I have reproduced it here with some minor modifications and translated it into English.
With the Hansalim Federation at the centre each of the stakeholders are listed along with their mutual responsibilities in relation to the Federation.
Hansalim’s stakeholders include five categories: Producers, Members (i.e. consumer members), Practitioners, Activists and the Local Community.

::: {#fig-stakeholders}

```{r}
#| label: stakeholders
```

![](../diagrams/stakeholders.png){group="diagrams"}

A map of Hansalim stakeholders and their responsibilities.
:::

Along with Producers, the Members share the main responsibility for governance of the federation and their local associations and Life Coops.
Members elect delegates to the General Assembly, participate in committees, respond to and carry out member surveys and also govern the business and movement activities of their own Life Coops.
Members are also expected to consume responsibly and encouraged to participate in activities to support producers and help the local community.
From the Federation they receive goods produced according to Hansalim standards and values as well as support (organisational and financial) for member engagement activities and member education.

Producers also elect delegates to the General Assembly, participate in the production consultation system and respond to and carry out producer surveys.
Their responsibility to the federation is to produce goods according to Hansalim standards and values and in return the federation is tasked with ensuring that their livelihoods are sustainable.

The Practitioners' main responsibility is for running the business activities of the member organisations and the shared business organisations (i.e. the Business Federation) but they also play a role in supporting the governance and movement activities.
Although Practitioners are not directly represented in the General Assembly, the executive directors (a Practitioner role) sit on the board of directors at each level of organisation from member to federation respectively.
The Workplace life council is the closest thing to a labour union in its role of representing the interests of Practitioners.
The Federation's responsibility to Practitioners is to support their training and performance and increase job satisfaction.
However, the role of Practitioners has evolved over time and is becoming increasingly ambiguous.
Originally, during Hansalim's early days, their main role was to act as a bridge between producers and consumers while running the business activities.
In the beginning people joined Hansalim as Practitioners to support their shared vision and often worked very long hours for low pay doing whatever was needed.
Now, as Hansalim has grown larger, many of those who worked for Hansalim from the early days have taken on managerial positions while the hiring of new employees has become more formalized and specialized.
As a consequence, the role of Practitioners as a bridge between consumers and producers has become weaker and the emphasis has shifted towards running business operations.

Activists were originally member volunteers whose role was to organize consumer activities and also act as a bridge with producers.
After a while, it was decided that they should be financially compensated for their work and their roles should be more clearly specified.
Now, Activists are members who have received training for specific roles and are paid a wage to work in the stores, receive phone orders and organize various activities for producers and members.

The Local Community is included as a stakeholder category as producers, members and activists seek to identify and take action on local needs.
They work with local community organizations and representatives of such organizations are also invited to participate on various councils as appropriate.
In fact, it is quite common for Hansalim members and producers to simultaneously hold official positions in Hansalim and other local grassroots organizations and social enterprises.

The organizational role of the Hansalim Federation in this structure is to support each of these different stakeholders to realize their own and Hansalim’s values in their various activities.
However, the Hansalim Federation as a specific organisation did not exist until 2011 and the Business Federation wasn't created until 2002 when 




## On a tumbling unfinished journey

The term used by the poet Kim Ji-ha to describe the evolutionary nature of a living movement such as Hansalim is "tilted balance" or a kind of dynamic (dis)equilibrium:

> "The philosophy of ‘tilted balance’, along with paradoxes, is crucial to understanding life.
> However, the term ‘tilted balance’ does not adequately describe the world of life.
> That is, the adjective 'tilted' and the noun ‘balance’, which denote states, do not capture the dynamism of the ever-changing world of life.
> The world of life is constantly tilting and tumbling rather than being in a stable balance."[^tilted1]

[^tilted1]: Kim Ji-ha, ‘On the Tilted Balance,’ The Complete Works of Kim Ji-ha, Volume 2, Practical Literature, 2002. Reproduced in: Yoon, Hyunggeun, ed. 2004. Salim’s Words. Mosim and Salim, Book 3. Seoul: Mosim and Salim Research Institute. p. 184-185. (Translation: J Dolley).

Yoon, in his 2024 report about Hansalim's evolving structure writes:

> "When choosing policies and institutions in Hansalim, we can present the 'tilted balance' in the "Hansalim Manifesto" as a decision-making principle that balances reality and ideals, associations and businesses."[^yoon2024]

[^yoon2024]: Yoon, Hyeong-Geun. 2024. “History of the Evolution of the Hansalim Composite Organisation.” 2023. Research Report. Seoul, Korea: Mosim and Salim Research Institute. p. 6. (Translation: J Dolley).

Hansalim's journey from a small movement of producers and consumers to a national federation has been far from smooth and simple.
As successful as it has been, it was and still is fraught with struggles, controversies, failures and frustrations.
One common phrase I heard from my interviewees in Hansalim is that "Hansalim looks beautiful from far away, but when you get closer you can see it is a lot more ugly."

That ugliness is the reality of trying to work and live together with people whose backgrounds, perspectives and desires are so often radically different and even competing.
It is the challenge of finding compromises that reflect a shared core of values while also trading off some of those values against others for the sake of a unity which is always and inevitably unsatisfactory.
That is why, in addition to "moderation" - the virtue required to find the "middle way" - "discernment" is also key to maintaining this continually oscillating 'tilted balance.'
Again, Kim Ji-ha explains this idea as a key aspect of the Confucian concept of the doctrine of the mean (中庸):

> "A more precise expression of this spirit is the term shijung (discernment - 时中), which appears in "The Doctrine of the Mean", the second of the Four Books, written by Confucius's grandson Zisi (子思).
> It means to strike a balance in an ever-changing situation.
> This kind of person is called a virtuous person.
> A person who is principled, but is also able to make judgements and adjust their behaviour according to the time and situation."[^tilted2]

It is this principle, rather than any specific organisational model,

## Conclusion

For those in Europe and other regions of the world outside Korea, Hansalim can appear to be a uniquely Korean phenomenon.
"Surely, it is only the collectivist culture of Korea that makes such a community possible.
It could never succeed in our hyper-individualist western societies."
But you must not forget that the two strongest influences on contemporary Korean culture are Confucianism and American consumerism.
The former provided the rationale for a strictly hierarchical and patriarchal culture that dominated Korean society for several hundred years before the latter collided head on with it during the post-war period, giving rise to a uniquely oppressive mixture of competitive consumerism and rigid conformism.

It was in this context that Hansalim emerged as a concrete expression of the desire felt among many at the time for a different kind of society built upon equality, mutual respect and care for other humans and the nonhuman world.
I have a feeling that this same desire has not gone away, but only deepened, not only among Koreans but equally among contemporary people in Europe and beyond.

However, no matter how much you desire to create something like Hansalim, managing such a large organization (or rather, federation of organisations) without a dictatorial head office but in a deliberative and democratic way is very, very hard work.
If you were in it for the money, you would not do it like this.
But for every member of Hansalim I have spoken to so far, its not about money, but about being part of a community dedicated to caring for each other and to creating a peaceful and thriving future for the world.
So as a reader from outside Korea who aspires to transform food systems, you need to keep in mind that Hansalim's success is mingled with failures and disappointments and comes at the cost of a great deal of personal sacrifice, collective conflict and agonising, trial and error and lots and lots and lots of ..... meetings.
Just look again at @fig-federation and notice the number of committee members in the column for Life Coops!

Having said all that, even if you are prepared for such a challenge, I do not think it is possible to simply transplant Hansalim's model to other countries.
It has its own history and unique context from which it emerged and it is not a static model but an evolving community in a continual process of change.

But what is perhaps much more useful than a blueprint, is Hansalim's story and the myriad stories of the people who practice Hansalim (as a verb).
These stories carry the values of Hansalim, the spirit and emotion of Hansalim people and the experience of countless challenges and success that they faced along the way.
These stories, more than anything else, carry the seeds that could produce new fruit in other contexts, as long as there are those with the determination to cultivate them.

To hear some of these stories, I am afraid you will have to wait a little longer for the rest of the book to be written and published. I'll do my best to finish it as soon as possible! Each new chapter will be published here as soon as it is written.

And of course, it is a story without an ending.
Which means, in all likelihood, there are those among you reading this book who will end up playing a role in it one way or another.
