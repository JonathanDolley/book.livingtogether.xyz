### The fight for independence {.unnumbered}

This part of the story starts in 1919 with the March First Movement and the struggle for independence against Japanese colonial rule. As part of this movement the first credit union was established in April 1919, the Kangkye Public Co-operative.[@Kim2017-xf, p. 355] Soon, similar cooperatives were established among housewives, students, workers, and farmers to promote the economic independence of Koreans from colonial domination. By 1938 there were more than 500 cooperatives with at least 140,000 members which helped to support the livelihoods of the poor and provide education to preserve the Korean language and cultural identity.[@Kim2022-im]



Instead, they were intent on building from the ground up, a democratic alternative based on what they called a 'worldview of life' and the expansion of the cooperative movement into all areas of social and economic life starting with the poorest and most marginalised in society.
