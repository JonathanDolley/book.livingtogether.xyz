# Cooperatives and sustainable development

Yet despite their manifold influence on the lives of consumers, workers and farmers across the world, the particular contribution of cooperatives to international development remains poorly understood \parencite{Wanyama2014-sy} and the movement has been relatively neglected by historians of social, economic or cultural development.


It is argued that, to the extent that cooperatives embody the values and principles of the social and solidarity economy they form a powerful but under-researched force for transformation towards a more inclusive and sustainable world \parencite{Wanyama2014-sy}.

# Tensions and roots of cooperative movement

As it has matured, the cooperative movement has continually faced the challenge of balancing economic objectives against social ones and negotiating the often ambiguous role of cooperative enterprises in a globalising economy dominated by capitalist structures and nationalist politics \parencite{Diamantopoulos2012-bg}
Nevertheless, from their multiple roots in Utopian socialism, anarchism and Catholic social teaching the British and European cooperative movements have preserved pockets of resistance against degeneration into capitalist modes that provide resources for the continuing regeneration of the wider movement \parencite{Hilson2018-bt,Cornforth1995-ll,Cole1944-lu}.

# Open Cooperatives, commoning and the social economy

The revival and development of multistakeholder cooperation (MSC) via the 'Open Cooperative' concept \parencite{Pazaitis2017-ri,Gonzalez2017-qe} and more recently the notion of Distributed Cooperative Organisations or DisCOs \parencite{Troncoso2019-bo} represents a renewed emphasis on cooperation as a means of creating alternative economies through practices of solidarity and commoning \parencite{Gibson-Graham2016-uf,Healy2021-gw,Bollier2020-ky}.

# Triple Estrangement

By reaching out from our own contexts to share with others in different geographical, cultural and economic situations we can give on another the benefit of temporary estrangement from the familiar. It is a double estrangement that gives each of us the ability to see the world in new ways. First I see your world as a stranger depending on you to guide me in response to my ignorance and curiosity. Second, as your world becomes more familiar to me I begin to see my own world as a stranger just as you begin to see your own world estranged through my eyes. Thus, finally you see your own context estranged through my eyes while I see my own equally estranged through your eyes. This double estrangement reveals the previously unseen oddities and opportunities for change that can give birth to transformative agency.

1) The view from outside.
I enter Hansalim as one estranged (my first estrangement).
Leaving my own familiar context behind and embracing the unfamiliar as one infatuated with the new and wonderful.
I pull at all the threads of strangeness and familiarity to test and break my preconceptions until I come a more detailed understanding.
I am able to compare my view of Hansalim with those of my interlocutors.
I see all the differences and commonalities, the expected and the unexpected.
This is a view biased by positive interpretation - all that is better than what I have seen before.
2) The view from inside.
After a while I feel so at home that my previous context seems less and less familiar and more strange.
I am estranged a second time, this time from my origin.
But as I push further on, I recognise both the beauty and the ugliness, the successes and the failures of my new home; until I am on the edge of disillusionment.
3) The view from all sides.
It is now time to become estranged again, by going as one familiar with Hansalim to those unfamiliar and attempting to communicate Hansalim and my own experience of Hansalim to others. To receive and respond to their questions.
Now, vicariously, through their estrangement (my own third estrangement), I see Hansalim again from another perspective.
This time it is as neither infatuated, nor disillusioned, but with love and discernment.
I see in the round but not from a objective abstract 'nowhere'. Rather I see from both inside and outside; with familiarity and estrangement simultaneously.

# Plural critical narrative as a method.

The research method employed by the lead author combined desk-based research with a series of reading group discussions between the lead author and researchers at Hansalim's Mosim and Salim Research Center.
Korean and English language literature was reviewed along with recent Korean language publications by Hansalim, archive materials and other relevant historical sources.
Regular reading group discussions facilitated shared critical and reflexive interpretation of the narrative accounts of Hansalim's founding and development to the present day. 
The second author draws on their own extensive experience working as a Mosim researcher and their more recent PhD and post-doctoral research on the Korean cooperative movement and Hansalim's founding philosophy.

In the following, we first outline the main ideas encompassed by the concept of New Cooperativism and present the analytical framework that guides our subsequent discussion of the Korean cooperative movement and the history and characteristics of the Hansalim Life Movement as an example of New Cooperativism in practice.
Finally, we reflect on the implications for New Cooperativism.

# Hansalim in numbers

Until now, the story of Hansalim has mainly been told in terms of the growth of an organic food consumer cooperative that began as a single rice store in Seoul in 1986 and grew to become one of the largest and most successful organic food cooperatives in the world.
Indeed, this story in itself is astonishing.
The following figures help give an idea of the scope and scale of Hansalim's activities in food and agriculture.
In 2021 (based on the 2022 report), Hansalim had 795,315 consumer members and 239 stores spread across 23 autonomous regional consumer cooperatives.
Hansalim's 13 municipal and 3 provincial producer associations encompass 2,278 producer households organised into 127 producer communities who cultivate a total of 4,856 ha of farmland (that is the equivalent of 27 average US farms based on an average US farm size of 445 acres or 180 ha \parencite{Usda2022-ry}).
In addition, there are 123 processing entities associated with Hansalim.
Sales were 493,630,000,000 KRW (431,510,597 USD - based on 2021 exchange rates 1,143.958 \parencite{Oecd2022-bf}).

However, this window on Hansalim only reveals part of the story.
Rather, as will become clear, it is better to think of Hansalim as a purpose driven alliance of autonomous cooperatives and associations of producers, consumers and workers organised around a solidarity-based economy and rooted in a shared spiritual philosophy of living together with one another and the non-human world.




By examining Hansalim through the lens of the four dimensions of NC described above, it is possible to see a broader picture than would be provided by the narrower perspective of Hansalim as an organic food supermarket run as a consumer cooperative.

# Historical context


The Life Movement emerged in the midst of the fight for democracy in Korea in the 1980s and formed as part of the organised resistance against the industrialist dictatorship which oppressed workers, destroyed the environment and devastated the rural economy \parencite{Hansalim2017-wo}.

It was launched by a loose network of autonomous cooperatives and producer associations who organised direct trade in organic foods at a time when rural communities faced impoverishment and environmental devastation and the cities were engulfed by mass protests in the fight for democracy against a brutal military dictatorship \textbackslash{}parencite\{Pak2016-nd,Ku2009-em\}.

# Han and Salim

In its simplest form, Hansalim's purpose is expressed in its name which is a composite of two native Korean words, \textit{han} (한) and \textit{salim} (살림).
\textit{Han} is the word for 'one' and 'great' or 'big' (as in Hangang, great river).
It also refers to the cosmos \parencite[21]{Mosim2004-bi} and, according to the Hansalim Manifesto, it contains a philosophical meaning expressed in a pair of complementary ideas.
The first pair, is the sense of being simultaneously collectively one and individually one.
The second, is the sense of simultaneously spreading out as one and gathering in as one; centrifugal diffusion and centripetal convergence \parencite[82]{Hansalim2021-cy}.\footnote{The authenticity of the notion of an ancient 'Han philosophy' is the subject of heated academic debate (see \textcite{Kim1986-bx} and \textcite{Baker2002-bs} for opposing sides). In relation to Hansalim's use of the word, the issue of whether it is a modern reinterpretation or a rediscovery of an ancient concept, is not a critical one. In Hansalim's case, the important point is that \textit{han} is a container for an assemblage of ideas about ontology, epistemology and oneness that runs through Eastern Philosophy from ancient times \parencite[]{Harrison2022-hj} and is used in place of Chinese terminology to put a Korean spin on some of those concepts.}

The combination of these two words \textit{han} and \textit{salim} expresses the vision of Hansalim to save or to nurture all of life.
This would require a civilisation-wide transformation of cultural values, economic organisation and personal consciousness that would amount to what the Manifesto called 'the dawn of a new world embodying heaven'  (\textit{hu-cheon-gae-byeok} / 후천개벽 / 後天開闢) - \parencite[p. 101]{Hansalim2021-cy}.

# Linking: civilisation change to ethics

This cosmic vision, though somewhat abstract and Utopian in its outline, is clearly recognisable in the mundane moments of every day life as the logical outworking of a practical ethic based on a specific metaphysical position that lies at the heart of Hansalim's philosophy.

# Jang Il-soon synthesis 

For Jang Il-soon, this synthesis was expressed in one of the core teachings of Donghak's second leader, Haewol. 

aimed to offer an alternative pathway for humans to co-exist in harmony and symbiosis with one another and with nature and to recover their true humanity which has been suppressed and all but erased by industrial civilization \parencite{Hansalim2021-cy}.


\begin{displayquote}
    Not long ago, we celebrated Easter, but during Holy Week, Pilate said to Jesus, ‘Hey, you say you are a king, don't you?’ and Jesus answered, ‘You call me a king?’ This is a very important statement. ‘You call me a king?’, ‘What kind of kingdom is yours?’, ‘The kingdom you are talking about is not the same as mine.’ He said that, didn't he? This is also a very important message in our Hansalim movement. When I say that your kingdom is different from mine, I mean that my kingdom is the kingdom of life. The kingdom of life. All things coexist, and all people coexist, and therefore, all people are kings. What kind of kings? The sons of God the Father are kings. The daughters of God the Father are queens. This means that without God the Father, without the source of life, we would not exist.

While in  -- in Korean traditional thought it is the "Way of the Flowing Wind" or poongryu-do (

whose movement originates in the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the two poles of taichi.
and to follow it by cultivating the mind of Divine Spirit within themselves.


The role of anyone seeking a civilisation of life instead of death and killing, is to learn to discern the Way (do/dao) and to embody it in daily life. 
However, in the vision of the manifesto, this is neither a hermit-like withdrawal from the world nor a passive submission or aligning with the blind forces of nature. 
The Way that is presented in the Manifesto is both contemplative and active and it is directly inspired by Jang Il-soon's interpretation of Catholic teaching, Seon Buddhism, Daoism and, most of all, the indigenous Korean religion called Donghak.


# Intro text

The full scope of Hansalim's ambition was announced in 1989 in the Hansalim Manifesto which was written following over a year of study and discussions by a diverse group of around 60 Korean pro-democracy activists, intellectuals, philosophers, artists, poets and farmers born between the 1920s - 40s who formed the "Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Hansalim Federation".

This document, which was recently translated into English, laid out the founders' full critique of modern civilisation and presented a grand project for the awakening of humanity and the transformation of humanity's relationship with the world, grounded in the teachings of the Korean indigenous religious philosophy of 'Donghak'.


Jang Il-soon established a cooperative in Wonju in 1985 that linked producers and consumers in economic relations of reciprocal care in opposition to capitalist economic principles of market exchange and competition \parencite[p. 91]{Baek2017-gh}.
As a nationwide organisation, the Catholic Farmers Association enabled the initial founders to rapidly bring together rural producers with urban consumers, share their ideas more widely and link up with other like-minded groups and peasant movements (Interview 5).
At this early stage there was already a keen awareness that care extended beyond human relations to the non-human world, and nowhere more obvious was this need than in farming.

# History of Hansalim in Wonju

From the foundation of Hansalim, it was producers themselves who led the drive for organic farming.
At this stage, the demand for organic produce among consumers more generally was negligible.
Producers, however, had first-hand experience of the dangerous effects of the state-led green revolution.
One of the founders, Kim Yeong-won, recalling the early days, explained that among the farmers movements at that time, there was growing shock at the obvious damage to the health of farmers and their livestock from pesticide use.
Deaths of farmers from pesticide poisoning where reported in the news media and farmers' personal experience seemed to contradict the claims of government and corporate spokes people that these chemicals were harmless.
Organic farming, therefore, was seen as the only way out of from what promised to be a catastrophic environmental health crisis \parencite[p. 128]{Hansalim2019-we}.
Organic farming was also connected with resistance against the oppressive state-corporate cabal that was fast gaining monopolies in agriculture and food.
Finally, it also represented support for rural livelihoods and independence from international corporations and self-sufficiency over against foreign imports \parencite[p. 133]{Hansalim2019-we}.

Under Jang Il-soon's influence, and nurtured by the Catholic Farmers, the nascent Life Movement took their first step to put into practice their vision of a new society.
The Wonju Consumer Cooperative Movement was founded in June 1985 and in 1986 they opened a single rice shop which provided the practical direct link between urban consumers and rural producers.
The following year, 1987, they published a statement of their vision of an alternative ecologically responsible and socially just society.
Soon after, in 1988 - with the housewife\footnote{In Korea, the term 'housewife', a translation of 'jubu' 주부, has long been a politicised term, defined and redefined in competing ways by state and colonial powers, reformers, nationalists, Korea's 'new women' and feminist intellectuals. Here it refers to the concept of the middle-class 'professional housewife' that arose in Korea during the colonial period and was further developed throughout Korea's rapid industrialisation \parencite{Yoo2008-ts,Yoo2005-bg,Suh2013-sa}.} Lee Soon-ro as its first chair of the board of directors - the Hansalim Community Consumer cooperative (with how many families? 1000?) was established alongside the Hansalim Producers Association (with 100 farmers organised into producer cooperatives) of Hansalim Community  \parencite{Hansalim2019-we}.

# Cultural purpose, labour

The labour of production is done in a culture of collaboration and democracy from field to the warehouse, a culture which is made visible to producer and consumer members through exchange visits, conferences and festivals.
The work 

efforts to initiate a society-wide transformation of awareness, values and lifestyle that would undermine the mechanistic worldview and instead embrace the notion of humanity's fundamental oneness with each other and with the life of the entire cosmos.

# Ethic and Donghak

While citing the similarities with the dynamic worldviews found in Brahmanical, Buddhist, Confucian and Daoist thought - the Manifesto draws most directly from the Korean indigenous religion of Donghak.

Founded in 1860 by Choe Je-u (Suun) \parencite{Young2014-an}, Donghak itself was a reaction against two oppressive forces in Korean society. The first was the Neo-Confucian social order which imposed a strict hierarchy of inequality, similar to a caste system, in order to maintain social order. 
The second was the disruptive influence of Japan, China and the Western powers which were each competing for political and economic power on the Korean peninsula and which brought foreign ideas and Christian missionaries in service of their imperialist aims \parencite{Seong2020-cv, Young2014-an}.

Donghak, therefore was more than simply nationalistic in its rejection of western ideas, it was also a radically egalitarian challenge to Korea's contemporary mainstream Neo-Confucian values \parencite{Seong2020-cv}.
It promised a complete revolution in social values and power relations on the basis of the fundamental equality of all beings as the carriers of the universal and immanent divine spirit (\textit{jigi}) \parencite[p. 77]{Baek2017-gh}.
And this is why it was perceived as so threatening by the Josun ruling elites who executed both its founder and subsequently its second leader Choe Sihyeong (Haewol) \parencite{Young2014-an}.
It was Haewol who synthesised Donghak thought into a practical social spirituality that was so formative for the philosophy Hansalim's founders and especially for Jang Il-soon.


# Summary of Ethic: Interpersonal


In summary, the Manifesto presents the world as a living unity of nested unities that is spiritual, holistic, dynamic and permeated throughout with intentionality and consciousness.
It claims that all things bear divine life which unifies the cosmos as a living whole and connects human persons to one another and the wider world through relationships of mutual recognition, affirmation and care which respect the autonomy and relationality of persons.
While modern ethical frameworks are based almost solely on the concept of individual rights, and increasingly shaped by the post-modern invention of identity politics, Hansalim’s emphasis is on responsibility for oneself and others.
This does not mean, however, that the individual is subordinated to the will of the community.

# Explanation of Hansalim's name
The combination of these two words \textit{han} and \textit{salim} expresses the vision of Hansalim to save or to nurture all of life.
This would require a civilisation-wide transformation of cultural values, economic organisation and personal consciousness that would amount to what the Manifesto called 'the dawn of a new world embodying heaven'  (\textit{hu-cheon-gae-byeok} / 후천개벽 / 後天開闢) - \parencite[p. 101]{Hansalim2021-cy}.

# Quote from Kim Boyoung about the flow of the river

NI-01 
There’s a river near my parents’ house. That river might intersect with Highway 11, but when it hasn’t been maintained, it gets flooded when it rains heavily, and when the rain stops, the water recedes, and the river shifts left or right. The water flows back and forth. In areas like this, where the river isn't as large as the Han River, the riverbed becomes exposed. It's a sandy riverbed. Korea has many rivers made of sand, so the water flow changes slightly depending on how much soil the rain carries away. But I think that's the essence of life. The region where the river flows becomes fertile, and civilization develops accordingly. Seeing that life moves in this way, sometimes producers raise their voices, sometimes practitioners take the lead, and sometimes consumers take the lead. If these three organisations all raise their voices, everything will collapse, and if no one says anything, everything will collapse, and if only one organisation takes the lead, everything will collapse. But I think that this constant flow is necessary for life to exist.

# Quote from Kim Boyoung about discussing

NI-01
Answers: [00:58:16] As a result of discussing these issues together and fighting fiercely, we were able to put our plans into practice. Based on my experience in the community, I want to continue to spread the message that the most important thing for our community members to do when participating in union activities is to support the conclusions that we have fought over. That’s actually really difficult. But when we talk together, maybe because there are many good people around me, they listen to such things. And I try to pay attention to that. However, when I took on this role, I realized there are such things. But when we convey decisions like, “We’ve made this decision,” it turns out to be different. In this case, the most common response is, “I didn’t agree, so I’ll oppose it.” If you want to do that, why do you gather together to discuss it? Just go away. You can't say that you discussed it. Even if we discussed it and came to a different conclusion, we discussed it together, and when we really agreed, we accepted it. But at some point, the flow changes again.

그렇게 하려면 왜 의논을 같이 모여서 해요. 그냥 나가지.  의논을 했다라고 그건 얘기할 수 없거든요. 그것을 의논을 해서 나랑 다른 결론이 나왔어도 우리는 함께 의논하고 진짜 승복할 때는  승복하고. 그런데 그게 어느 시점이 되면 또 흐름이 바뀌더라고요.

# Expanding broken ones from farmers to others

At the time Hansalim was founded, it was the small-scale farmers who were the 'broken ones' but as Hansalim has matured and society has changed, it has become clear that there are now many other broken ones in both urban and rural areas who are suffering loneliness, poverty and sickness.
By expanding activities into the care sector, Hansalim is beginning to expand its reach to embrace such people.

# Life Coops and Producer Federations do this

The 30 Life Cooperatives and the 15 Producer Federations maintain a national federation to manage their shared business activities such as logistics, product development, marketing and purchasing, run the national-level activities of the Life Movement including publishing, research, food life education and policy advocacy and to provide support to the federation’s member organisations.

# Arendt place of appearance

This can be understood as the integration of Action into every aspect of Hansalim's operations through the creation 'spaces of appearance' in every possible context.
These are spaces in which "I appear to others as others appear to me"  \parencite[p. 200]{Arendt2018-dn}.; that is, "within a community of equals where everybody has the same capacity to act"  \parencite[p. 244]{Arendt2018-dn} and which is held together not by systems of sanction or reward, but by the "force of mutual promise" \parencite[p. 245]{Arendt2018-dn}.

# Quotes about meetings and discussion

The chair of directors of one of Hansalim's Life Coops (NI-04 - 00:11:22) put it this way:

\begin{displayquote}
    "As some have said in a crude way: Hansalim equals meetings. Nothing happens without a meeting and you are participating in many of them.
\end{displayquote}
And further (NI-04 00:29:37):

\begin{displayquote}
    Whether it is at a conference or in a conversation, we must all agree on the most important issues and work together toward a common goal. It is very difficult if only one person agrees, but if 100 people agree, we can move forward. I believe that our organization has the ability to achieve this.
\end{displayquote}
Speaking of her participation in the agricultural production committee one consumer representative explained that (NI-01 - 00:18:30):

\begin{displayquote}
    Through this process, I began to see what we might be missing. So, I became more sensitive to areas where misunderstandings could arise. Through this experience, I realized that we shouldn't avoid opposition, but rather view it as a way to check and balance each other. However, there are times when opposition arises just for the sake of opposing. So, while not everything is right, I still think we should approach it that way.
\end{displayquote}

# Activities of resistance

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hansalim’s food life education institute trains educators to teach children, students, elderly and marginalised groups about nutrition, food preparation, sustainability and ecology.
    \item Hansalim’s publishing house and research institute produce books and other materials telling the stories and history of the movement and its members as well as providing analysis and policy advice which helps to influence the wider public discussion about sustainable futures.
    \item Conferences and forums, online seminars, websites and blogs all contribute to spreading the message of the Life Movement.
    \item Festivals bring members together for feasting and celebration and provide an opportunity to engage with people who are not yet familiar with Hansalim.
    \item Finally, public protest also plays a big role in Hansalim’s efforts to change opinions among the wider public and policy makers.
\end{enumerate}

# Cut from Alterity and hospitality sub-section

This means that from its foundation until the present, Hansalim has tried to accommodate the needs and preferences of consumers and producers whose values may only align to a small degree with the movements' founders while providing education and assistance to encourage them to adopt more of Hansalim's shared Values and Practices.



To that end, consumption is linked as closely to production as possible through contract purchasing and collaborative price setting which aims to ensure 75 percent of the sale price is returned to the farmers themselves.
A centrally held production stabilization fund, contributed to by each producer community, offers some compensation to farmers facing crop loss (this is in addition to the nationalised agricultural insurance scheme available to all farmers).
This is essentially a mechanism to redistribute resources among producer communities according to need to cope with unpredictable weather, disease and pest damage.

in the creative action of building an alternative economy which engages as little as possible in the competitive market relations of contemporary capitalism.
Hansalim rejected no only the shareholder model of ownership but also the capitalist principles of market-based competition and consumption.
The former is an act of resistance against the 'one dollar, one vote' model of economic control by adopting the traditional cooperative model of 'one member, one vote'.
The latter is an act of resistance against the inequalities and injustices embedded in the capitalist market which externalises environmental and social costs and rewards the use of purchasing power to drive down input costs and wages to satisfy creditors.

Hansalim sought to create an alternative economy that is not driven by depersonalised transactions through the capitalist market but rather by the trust 


The activity of production is also democratised through the formation of producer communities who cooperate together.
By avoiding synthetic external inputs, producing their own seed, growing their own animal feed, and recycling wastes as inputs many producer communities are able to limit dependence on commercial suppliers and insulate themselves from volatile markets relative to conventional farmers.
Finally, to provide stable and secure livelihoods for producers, Hansalim has effectively turned the market upside down.
Instead of purchasing to match fluctuating demand and pushing the risk only producers, they purchase mostly on contract.
To make this work the Federation takes on the risk of a mismatch between supply and demand and plans ahead what quantity to produce based on preious years data and future projections.

However, Hansalim does not restrict producer communities from selling outside Hansalim.
This provides a lot of flexibility and allows a wide diversity of livelihood strategies for producer members who may sell exclusively through Hansalim or alternatively sell only a small percentage of their produce while selling the rest through other channels.
It also means that producer communities are not entirely dependent upon the federation for their livelihoods which adds an important level of resilience.

The result is a kind of hybrid system which provides a comprehensive alternative to the conventional supermarket for consumer members while providing varying degrees of integration for producer members depending on their preference.


restores the role of trust between people whose transactions express the mutual understanding that the goods provided and the money exchanged represent 

Changing the relationship between profit and investment. The funds to invest in capital for future development (vehicles, offices, shops) are integrated into each transaction rather than taken from profits after the fact.


The latter aim, however, exposes Hansalim to market forces by making a significant proportion of its income dependent upon changes in market conditions.
Thus, Hansalim's business model is not only vulnerable to rising costs of production, but also to price retail fluctuations, because a large portion of Hansalim's income is from sales in direct competition to other organic shops and supermarkets which have entered the organic food market in force in recent years.
Because Hansalim purchases most products on contracts at pre-set prices and quantities, it cannot adjust supply to respond to changes in demand.
Instead, it uses a centrally held price adjustment fund which is used to absorb price cuts and special offers on certain products to stimulate sales.
This fund is collected from a percentage of sales so as to effectively hedge against future changes in demand.

The tension between the ideals of alterity and hospitality - the desire to create a different economy while also seeking to continue functioning within the capitalist economy - creates an intense pressure on nearly every aspect of Hansalim's activities.
It is this challenge that has forced Hansalim to continue to adapt to the changing market and consumer preferences even while attempting to influence consumer behaviour and build solidarity between consumers and producers.
It is one of the reasons for Hansalim's rapid growth in consumer membership but also the cause of many difficulties in managing distribution and production, made even more challenging by the impact of climate change.
However, not only does Hansalim strive to provide food and other products as inclusively as possible, but it also uses funds from its economic activities to support a range of actions aimed at serving the public and community interests.

# Quote from Vision 30 report

==The true appearance of life is not fixed but is constantly generated and changed. In Hansalim's philosophy, this logic of "not so, yet so"(不然其然) is not only the perception of seeing the world, but also the basis for our actions and practices.==
%%생명의 역사가 진화의 역사이고, 그것이 가능했던 이유는 드러나는 모습 이면에 ‘그렇지 않은 모습’이 존재하기 때문입니다. 그렇지 않은 것이 어느 순간 드러남으로써 생성 변화를 추동해 왔기 때문에 진화할 수 있었던 것이지요. 생명의 참 모습은 고정되지 않고 끊임없이 생성 변화하는 데 있습니다. 한살림의 철학에서는 이런 ‘아니다, 그렇다(不然其然)’의 논리를 세상을 보는 인식뿐만 아니라 우리의 행위, 실천의 준거로 삼습니다.%%

 ==The moment we are neat and obsessed with 'this', all possibilities are ruled out. It's always open to possibilities other than this. Otherwise, evolution stops. In the work of establishing a vision for the future of Hansalim, we must also be able to use the "not so much" that is not revealed behind the present revealed appearance of Hansalim as a new dynamic. And it is important to live out the vision so much as you can, but not to dwell on the consequences, not to be confined (生而不有長而不宰, begotten but not owned, raised and grown, but not at will).==
%%우리가 ‘이거’라고 단정하고 집착하는 순간, 모든 가능성은 배제되어 버립니다. ‘이것이 아닌’ 다른 가능성을 늘 열어놓는 것이지요. 그렇지 않으면 진화가 멈춥니다. 한살림의 미래 비전을 세우는 일에서도 현재 한살림의 드러난 모습 이면에 드러나지 않은 ‘그렇지 않은 모습’을 새로운 동력으로 삼을 수 있어야 합니다. 그리고 그렇게 만들어진 비전을 최선을 다해 실천하되, 그 결과에 머물지 않는 것, 가두지 않는 것이 중요합니다(生而不有 長而不宰, 낳았으되 소유하지 않고, 키우고 자라게 했지만 마음대로 부리지 않는다).%%

==In 'The Universe in a Grain of Rice', we find a section where Teacher Mu Yu spoke of contradictory standards and principles about Hansalim.[^3] That's not a back-and-forth statement, but a but it should be read as advice on the logic of "not so, yet so", the philosophy of situations that loosen when you try to loosen up, the philosophy of Hansalim based on the philosophy of evolution, the philosophy of the situation that is supplely released when it is tightening and hardening.== (This is probably the same reason why there are so many different things about Jesus' words in the Bible.)
%%『나락 한 알 속의 우주』에서는 무위당 선생이 한살림에 대해 서로 상반되는 기준과 원칙을 말씀하신 부분을 찾을 수 있습니다.[^3] 그건 앞뒤가 안 맞는 얘기가 아니라 <아니다, 그렇다>의 논리, 즉 헐거워지려고 할 때 조이고 굳어질 때 유연하게 풀어내는 상황의 철학, 진화의 철학을 바탕으로 한 한살림에 대한 조언으로 읽어야 할 것입니다. 그 시점, 그 상황에 맞게, 갇혀 있는 현재의 굴레에서 벗어나서 변화 생동하는 역동성을 갖게 하려는 선생의 애정이 담긴 말씀인 것이지요. (성경에서 예수님의 말씀이 앞뒤가 다른 얘기가 많은 이유도 이와 같을 것입니다.)%%

Hansalim, who has been beaten thirty stones, is so excited and good. ==But this can also be a stumbling block for us. You have to be humble. You have to know how to shake off what you have. Today, 30 years old, we celebrate and rejoice with pride, but after this moment we will have to go back to the bottom and paint a new 30 years.==

# The motivation for Su-un's teaching about sagehood

Su-un taught his approach as a rejection of the hypocrisy and formalism of contemporary Neo-Confucian society and as a means of making 'sagehood' - or unity with \textit{Hanul} - accessible to anyone regardless of education, social status or privilege.

# Filler from Governance section

Its distinctiveness can easily be missed, hidden as it were in plain view; the seemingly mundane and often frustrating activity of getting things done within a complex and apparently convoluted system.
On closer inspection, there are several aspects of Hansalim's structure and governance processes that look puzzling if viewed from the perspective of organisational efficiency but which give rise to three features of the movement which we argue have been crucial factors in its resilience.

# Volunteering and exchanges



 7) volunteer labour in solidarity with producers or in consumer-producer collaboration for charitable causes.

# Machine metaphor vs Life metaphor

In the chapter "Holistic Life's Creative Evolution" the concept of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics are used to construct a theory of change which directly contradicts the Newtonian mechanistic model by drawing on contemporary ideas in New Science and ancient Korean thought.
According to the Manifesto, industrialised civilisation operates as if it were a closed system, underpinned by a concept of time as absolute, uniform and reversible.
In contrast, the theory of thermodynamics conceives of time as relative, non-uniform and irreversible.
In a closed system, according to the second law, entropy (disorder) accumulates tending towards a static equilibrium state of motionlessness and death.
In an open system, through self-organising processes and continual interactions, time and entropy give rise to higher dimensions of order as the web of living beings coevolve with cosmic life in a continual "becoming".

The contrast between the machine model and life model of change is described in six pairs of dichotomies and a final statement about spirit.
First, while the machine is an artificial "being" made for a pre-defined purpose, life exists in a mode of "becoming" as it grows and matures according to its own internal identity.
Second, the machine is a simple collection of replaceable parts but life is a whole made up of nested interdependent wholes which simultaneously express individuality and collective unity.
Third, the machine is ordered by a rigid design while life displays a flexible interaction between order and consistency on the one hand, and autonomy, irregularity and diversity on the other.
Fourth, while the machine is a heteronomous tool (a means to an end), life is autonomously motivated by internal intentions which operate within, but not completely determined by, the limits of the environment.
Fifth, as opposed to the closed system of the machine, life is an open system of mutual exchanges of matter, energy and information that is not only self-renewing but also creative in its interaction with the environment.
Microcosm and macrocosm coevolve to continually transcend their previous limitations.
Sixth, the machine operates according to linear cause and effect.
Life thrives on disequilibrium, characterised by non-linear circulating feedbacks that provide the creative capacity to overcome former limitations and adapt to external and internal disturbances.
Finally, implying the non-dualism of ancient Korean shamanism, the Manifesto argues that life is "spirit" (Hanul or cosmic divinity) and that this creative spirit permeates all things.
Matter is seen not as the opposite of spirit but as co-inherent with it and expressing another aspect of the divine spirit alongside the development of reflexive consciousness and culture that characterises the human spirit.

## Not so yet so

It is expressed in the three concepts of hucheon-gaebyeok (후천개벽, 後天開闢, moo-we-ee-hwa (무위이화, 無爲而化) and bul-yeon-gi-yeon (불연기연 不然其然).
The first, hucheon-gaebyeok translates literally as "the dawn of a new world embodying heaven".
The Manifesto interprets this to mean that the dismantling of the old order of 'killing' and creation of a new order of 'life' cannot be achieved through forcing or violent revolution but through a creative and cooperative evolution described in the phrase "moo-we-ee-hwa".
This second phrase translates roughly as "change through non-action" or "action which does not seek to contrive or force anything".
This is interpreted to mean that, "as part of the natural, unforced evolutionary process of the universe, human evolution results from the awakening and observed practices of people carrying heaven within." \parencite[p. 102]{Hansalim2021-cy}.
However, it is understood not as a narrowly deterministic biological process but from the perspective of the cosmos as an evolving unity of microcosms and macrocosms.
Its evolution is a dynamic process of change from simplicity towards complexity and from disorder toward order; a paradoxical relationship between the '"one" becoming "many"' and the '"many" becoming integrated as "one."' \parencite[p. 107]{Hansalim2021-cy}.
The interaction of these two energies gives rise to the continuing processes of self-transcendence and self-organisation through which "all levels of life transcend the limitations of their existence and extend forward..." and "driven by agitations, organize themselves into a new order."  \parencite[p. 107]{Hansalim2021-cy}.

Unlike the Hegelian or Marxian dialectic it is not a deterministic evolution driven by the logic of the synthesis of opposites or the self-realisation of Geist as the progress of history .... Idealist logic or materialist logic...
Instead, it is a creative evolution that unfolds through an epistemological logic of bul-yeon-gi-yeon or "not so, yet so".

Commenting on the Donghak scripture, Kim and Yoon \parencite{Kim2007-sv} explain this concept as follows:%quote-ICA

"According to Suun, we usually live in the phenomenal world of ordinary experience, which is \textit{giyeon}. However, ultimately and in the deepest level of our being we live in the world of \textit{buryeon}, which lies beyond the realm of the ordinary sense experience." \parencite[p. 72]{Kim2007-sv}.


This sets up a contradiction between appearance and becoming, Wirkweld and Merkweld, nature naturans and nature natura.... that is resolved by reference to a transcendent reality, Hanul.

# Machine metaphor vs Rice metaphor and buryeon giyeon

The alternative metaphor to the machine in the mechanistic world view is the symbol of a bowl of rice. Which represenets the real connection between prodution and consumption, humanity and nature etc. The bowl of rice is not just a different symbol but also works as a metphor in a differnt way to the machine metaphor. The machine metaphor is a 1:1 representation of the universe in a static relationship to its metaphorical symbol (in the mode of giyeon) while the bowl of rice is not meant as a 1:1 representation but as a node or a kind of singularity in which all the connections in the cosmos come together (thus it is a metphorical symbol in the mode of bujyeon).

# Balancing constituting power and constituent power

Pitfalls of too little hierarchy and structure vs too much. On the one hand, bullying and de facto rule by personality, on the other hand bureaucracy and rule by no-one. Finding a balance between constituting power and constituted power.
Hierarchy and structure places limits but, also by those limits, creates capacity for power to be created among equals rather than the force of some to constrict the power of all.

# Burmiester's mistaken assessment of the potential for civil society in Kroea


"In South Korea, the likelihood of rapid development of a robust civil society69 in rural areas in the post-authoritarian period must be treated with some skepticism.70 In the context of a Confucian local political culture that values  consensus  building  within  the  confines  of  a  morally  integrated community over and above the promotion of group affiliations based on common  self-interest71  and  in  the  social  context  of  extreme  sectoral homogeneity, post-liberation bureaucratic-authoritarian regimes were able to  redeploy  organizational  infrastructure  developed  during  the  colonial period to harness agriculture to the national development project and to manipulate the sector politically on clientelist terms. This was not fertile social terrain for the development of a robust, autonomous associational life.  Those  counterhegemonic  organizations  that  did  develop  (e.g.  farm organizations  affiliated  with  religious  groups  like  the  Catholic  Farmers Organization)  were  not  able  to  generate  what  Gramsci  might  term  an ‘organic,’  farmer-based  leadership  with  organizational  resources  that ‘pluralized’ the organizational field." \parencite[132]{Burmeister1999-gt} Turned out to be wrong didn't he!!


# What has Hansalim contributed?

The complexity and the diversity of Hansalim creates a lot of extra work. But its outcomes include a lot more than just higher incomes for farmers and some social connections. It has created hundreds of books and other publications of rich research and inspiring narrative. It has trained thousands of educators and activists. It influenced changes in government policy, created a national movement and numerous spinoff coops. It has transformed many individuals and communities in profound ways.
I believe it is Its complexity and diversity is the key to its creativity and resilience.
5.
6. This is why the role of practitioners in Hansalim is so important and why they should be paid more and given plenty of holiday to recharge from all their frustration performing all the extra work created by Hansalim’s maximal solution.


# Conclusion type paragraph

We can no longer think about social development or sustainable development in the reductionist terms handed down to us by materialism and empiricism.
Instead, we need to ask the more fundamental questions about what it means to be human in a world that is alive and in continuous motion.
And therefore, what forms of human flourishing can we aspire to that will be regenerative and nurturing to all life rather than destructive and degrading.
It is time for the cooperative movement to get philosophical and as GOEL founder says, discover a practical ethic that does not simply begin and end with economic and social indicators, but ....
It has grown out of its Utopian Socialist roots but has not yet found another source of inspiration besides the empiricist heritage of the enlightenment and the mechanistic Newtonian worldview.
Perhaps Hansalim's philosophy offers some new inspiration.


# What Hansalim is not


In the light of all this, Hansalim should probably be thought of, not simply as a cooperative, but as a social and ecological movement, an experiment in grassroots deliberative democracy.
So it is important to challenge some assumptions the people might bring to understanding Hansalim as an organization.
Firstly, from the perspective of an alternative food system, it is not a stable or static model.
As Hansalim has expanded in response to the growing organic food market in Korea, it has experienced many changes in structure and policy.
It has had to adapt to the changing scale of production and distribution operations as well as cultural and economic changes in Korea.
So it very much a food system in a constant process of adaptation rather than a stable model that can be copied to another context.

Secondly, it is also important to recognize that Hansalim is not really a single organization but a federation made up of a wide diversity of autonomous communities and associations, each with their own distinct histories and values.

Finally, it is not an exclusive movement but is actually inclusive of different farming philosophies from low-input conventional methods through to organic and integrated farming systems.
And in terms of participation of farmers, they range from being more or less dependent on Hansalim for their livelihoods.
For example some farmers will supply only to Hansalim while others may supply a portion of their produce to Hansalim while selling the rest through other channels.
Hansalim contains a whole diversity of examples that lie closer or further away from the ideal.

# Conclusion type paragraph

Hansalim has developed and survived within a hostile food system built on simplifying and uniformity to achieve efficiency and provide a consistent experience to consumers. Hansalim has achieved the same consistent experience but with radical enhancements with a system that is not at all based on simplicity, uniformity or efficiency. That in itself is remarkable. But Hansalim has done much more than simply create supermarkets.

# Summary of Life Cooperativism

If we modified the features of New Cooperativism according to what we now understand of Hansalim's Life Cooperativism we could answer question 1 as follows.
Their purpose would be defined in terms of personal, economic and cultural transformation towards peace and mutual flourishing of all life, human and nonhuman.
Their ethic would be defined in terms of a spiritual (non-materialist) worldview, mutual care grounded in respect for the intrinsic dignity of all, and a conscious balancing of individual and group needs.
Their political-economic orientation would be neither revolutionary nor reformist, not seeking to 'destroy capitalism' but to offer a functional alternative which nevertheless maintains an interface with the market against which it stands and enables a self-giving generosity towards 'outsiders.'
Their approach to multi-stakeholder governance will make room for personal joyful interactions, the cultivation of power through face-to-face encounter and embrace conflict as a central facet of multi-stakeholder cooperation rather than pursue purity of ideology.
