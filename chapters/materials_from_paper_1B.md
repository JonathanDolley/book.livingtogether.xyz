# Cooperatives and sustainable development

Yet despite their manifold influence on the lives of consumers, workers and farmers across the world, the particular contribution of cooperatives to international development remains poorly understood \parencite{Wanyama2014-sy} and the movement has been relatively neglected by historians of social, economic or cultural development.


It is argued that, to the extent that cooperatives embody the values and principles of the social and solidarity economy they form a powerful but under-researched force for transformation towards a more inclusive and sustainable world \parencite{Wanyama2014-sy}.

# Tensions and roots of cooperative movement

As it has matured, the cooperative movement has continually faced the challenge of balancing economic objectives against social ones and negotiating the often ambiguous role of cooperative enterprises in a globalising economy dominated by capitalist structures and nationalist politics \parencite{Diamantopoulos2012-bg}
Nevertheless, from their multiple roots in Utopian socialism, anarchism and Catholic social teaching the British and European cooperative movements have preserved pockets of resistance against degeneration into capitalist modes that provide resources for the continuing regeneration of the wider movement \parencite{Hilson2018-bt,Cornforth1995-ll,Cole1944-lu}.

# Open Cooperatives, commoning and the social economy

The revival and development of multistakeholder cooperation (MSC) via the 'Open Cooperative' concept \parencite{Pazaitis2017-ri,Gonzalez2017-qe} and more recently the notion of Distributed Cooperative Organisations or DisCOs \parencite{Troncoso2019-bo} represents a renewed emphasis on cooperation as a means of creating alternative economies through practices of solidarity and commoning \parencite{Gibson-Graham2016-uf,Healy2021-gw,Bollier2020-ky}.

# Triple Estrangement

By reaching out from our own contexts to share with others in different geographical, cultural and economic situations we can give on another the benefit of temporary estrangement from the familiar. It is a double estrangement that gives each of us the ability to see the world in new ways. First I see your world as a stranger depending on you to guide me in response to my ignorance and curiosity. Second, as your world becomes more familiar to me I begin to see my own world as a stranger just as you begin to see your own world estranged through my eyes. Thus, finally you see your own context estranged through my eyes while I see my own equally estranged through your eyes. This double estrangement reveals the previously unseen oddities and opportunities for change that can give birth to transformative agency.

1) The view from outside.
I enter Hansalim as one estranged (my first estrangement).
Leaving my own familiar context behind and embracing the unfamiliar as one infatuated with the new and wonderful.
I pull at all the threads of strangeness and familiarity to test and break my preconceptions until I come a more detailed understanding.
I am able to compare my view of Hansalim with those of my interlocutors.
I see all the differences and commonalities, the expected and the unexpected.
This is a view biased by positive interpretation - all that is better than what I have seen before.
2) The view from inside.
After a while I feel so at home that my previous context seems less and less familiar and more strange.
I am estranged a second time, this time from my origin.
But as I push further on, I recognise both the beauty and the ugliness, the successes and the failures of my new home; until I am on the edge of disillusionment.
3) The view from all sides.
It is now time to become estranged again, by going as one familiar with Hansalim to those unfamiliar and attempting to communicate Hansalim and my own experience of Hansalim to others. To receive and respond to their questions.
Now, vicariously, through their estrangement (my own third estrangement), I see Hansalim again from another perspective.
This time it is as neither infatuated, nor disillusioned, but with love and discernment.
I see in the round but not from a objective abstract 'nowhere'. Rather I see from both inside and outside; with familiarity and estrangement simultaneously.

# Plural critical narrative as a method.

The research method employed by the lead author combined desk-based research with a series of reading group discussions between the lead author and researchers at Hansalim's Mosim and Salim Research Center.
Korean and English language literature was reviewed along with recent Korean language publications by Hansalim, archive materials and other relevant historical sources.
Regular reading group discussions facilitated shared critical and reflexive interpretation of the narrative accounts of Hansalim's founding and development to the present day. 
The second author draws on their own extensive experience working as a Mosim researcher and their more recent PhD and post-doctoral research on the Korean cooperative movement and Hansalim's founding philosophy.

In the following, we first outline the main ideas encompassed by the concept of New Cooperativism and present the analytical framework that guides our subsequent discussion of the Korean cooperative movement and the history and characteristics of the Hansalim Life Movement as an example of New Cooperativism in practice.
Finally, we reflect on the implications for New Cooperativism.

# Hansalim in numbers

Until now, the story of Hansalim has mainly been told in terms of the growth of an organic food consumer cooperative that began as a single rice store in Seoul in 1986 and grew to become one of the largest and most successful organic food cooperatives in the world.
Indeed, this story in itself is astonishing.
The following figures help give an idea of the scope and scale of Hansalim's activities in food and agriculture.
In 2021 (based on the 2022 report), Hansalim had 795,315 consumer members and 239 stores spread across 23 autonomous regional consumer cooperatives.
Hansalim's 13 municipal and 3 provincial producer associations encompass 2,278 producer households organised into 127 producer communities who cultivate a total of 4,856 ha of farmland (that is the equivalent of 27 average US farms based on an average US farm size of 445 acres or 180 ha \parencite{Usda2022-ry}).
In addition, there are 123 processing entities associated with Hansalim.
Sales were 493,630,000,000 KRW (431,510,597 USD - based on 2021 exchange rates 1,143.958 \parencite{Oecd2022-bf}).

However, this window on Hansalim only reveals part of the story.
Rather, as will become clear, it is better to think of Hansalim as a purpose driven alliance of autonomous cooperatives and associations of producers, consumers and workers organised around a solidarity-based economy and rooted in a shared spiritual philosophy of living together with one another and the non-human world.




By examining Hansalim through the lens of the four dimensions of NC described above, it is possible to see a broader picture than would be provided by the narrower perspective of Hansalim as an organic food supermarket run as a consumer cooperative.

# Historical context


The Life Movement emerged in the midst of the fight for democracy in Korea in the 1980s and formed as part of the organised resistance against the industrialist dictatorship which oppressed workers, destroyed the environment and devastated the rural economy \parencite{Hansalim2017-wo}.

It was launched by a loose network of autonomous cooperatives and producer associations who organised direct trade in organic foods at a time when rural communities faced impoverishment and environmental devastation and the cities were engulfed by mass protests in the fight for democracy against a brutal military dictatorship\parencite{Pak2016-nd,Ku2009-em}.

# Linking: civilisation change to ethics

This cosmic vision, though somewhat abstract and Utopian in its outline, is clearly recognisable in the mundane moments of every day life as the logical outworking of a practical ethic based on a specific metaphysical position that lies at the heart of Hansalim's philosophy.

# Jang Il-soon synthesis 

For Jang Il-soon, this synthesis was expressed in one of the core teachings of Donghak's second leader, Haewol. 

aimed to offer an alternative pathway for humans to co-exist in harmony and symbiosis with one another and with nature and to recover their true humanity which has been suppressed and all but erased by industrial civilization \parencite{Hansalim2021-cy}.

    Not long ago, we celebrated Easter, but during Holy Week, Pilate said to Jesus, ‘Hey, you say you are a king, don't you?’ and Jesus answered, ‘You call me a king?’ This is a very important statement. ‘You call me a king?’, ‘What kind of kingdom is yours?’, ‘The kingdom you are talking about is not the same as mine.’ He said that, didn't he? This is also a very important message in our Hansalim movement. When I say that your kingdom is different from mine, I mean that my kingdom is the kingdom of life. The kingdom of life. All things coexist, and all people coexist, and therefore, all people are kings. What kind of kings? The sons of God the Father are kings. The daughters of God the Father are queens.

While in  -- in Korean traditional thought it is the "Way of the Flowing Wind" or poongryu-do (

whose movement originates in the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the two poles of taichi.
and to follow it by cultivating the mind of Divine Spirit within themselves.


The role of anyone seeking a civilisation of life instead of death and killing, is to learn to discern the Way (do/dao) and to embody it in daily life. 
However, in the vision of the manifesto, this is neither a hermit-like withdrawal from the world nor a passive submission or aligning with the blind forces of nature. 
The Way that is presented in the Manifesto is both contemplative and active and it is directly inspired by Jang Il-soon's interpretation of Catholic teaching, Seon Buddhism, Daoism and, most of all, the indigenous Korean religion called Donghak.


# Intro text

The full scope of Hansalim's ambition was announced in 1989 in the Hansalim Manifesto which was written following over a year of study and discussions by a diverse group of around 60 Korean pro-democracy activists, intellectuals, philosophers, artists, poets and farmers born between the 1920s - 40s who formed the "Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Hansalim Federation".

This document, which was recently translated into English, laid out the founders' full critique of modern civilisation and presented a grand project for the awakening of humanity and the transformation of humanity's relationship with the world, grounded in the teachings of the Korean indigenous religious philosophy of 'Donghak'.


Jang Il-soon established a cooperative in Wonju in 1985 that linked producers and consumers in economic relations of reciprocal care in opposition to capitalist economic principles of market exchange and competition \parencite[p. 91]{Baek2017-gh}.
As a nationwide organisation, the Catholic Farmers Association enabled the initial founders to rapidly bring together rural producers with urban consumers, share their ideas more widely and link up with other like-minded groups and peasant movements (Interview 5).
At this early stage there was already a keen awareness that care extended beyond human relations to the non-human world, and nowhere more obvious was this need than in farming.

# History of Hansalim in Wonju

From the foundation of Hansalim, it was producers themselves who led the drive for organic farming.
At this stage, the demand for organic produce among consumers more generally was negligible.
Producers, however, had first-hand experience of the dangerous effects of the state-led green revolution.
One of the founders, Kim Yeong-won, recalling the early days, explained that among the farmers movements at that time, there was growing shock at the obvious damage to the health of farmers and their livestock from pesticide use.
Deaths of farmers from pesticide poisoning where reported in the news media and farmers' personal experience seemed to contradict the claims of government and corporate spokes people that these chemicals were harmless.
Organic farming, therefore, was seen as the only way out of from what promised to be a catastrophic environmental health crisis \parencite[p. 128]{Hansalim2019-we}.
Organic farming was also connected with resistance against the oppressive state-corporate cabal that was fast gaining monopolies in agriculture and food.
Finally, it also represented support for rural livelihoods and independence from international corporations and self-sufficiency over against foreign imports \parencite[p. 133]{Hansalim2019-we}.

Under Jang Il-soon's influence, and nurtured by the Catholic Farmers, the nascent Life Movement took their first step to put into practice their vision of a new society.
The Wonju Consumer Cooperative Movement was founded in June 1985 and in 1986 they opened a single rice shop which provided the practical direct link between urban consumers and rural producers.
The following year, 1987, they published a statement of their vision of an alternative ecologically responsible and socially just society.
Soon after, in 1988 - with the housewife\footnote{In Korea, the term 'housewife', a translation of 'jubu' 주부, has long been a politicised term, defined and redefined in competing ways by state and colonial powers, reformers, nationalists, Korea's 'new women' and feminist intellectuals. Here it refers to the concept of the middle-class 'professional housewife' that arose in Korea during the colonial period and was further developed throughout Korea's rapid industrialisation \parencite{Yoo2008-ts,Yoo2005-bg,Suh2013-sa}.} Lee Soon-ro as its first chair of the board of directors - the Hansalim Community Consumer cooperative (with how many families? 1000?) was established alongside the Hansalim Producers Association (with 100 farmers organised into producer cooperatives) of Hansalim Community  \parencite{Hansalim2019-we}.

# Cultural purpose, labour

The labour of production is done in a culture of collaboration and democracy from field to the warehouse, a culture which is made visible to producer and consumer members through exchange visits, conferences and festivals.
The work 

efforts to initiate a society-wide transformation of awareness, values and lifestyle that would undermine the mechanistic worldview and instead embrace the notion of humanity's fundamental oneness with each other and with the life of the entire cosmos.

# Ethic and Donghak

While citing the similarities with the dynamic worldviews found in Brahmanical, Buddhist, Confucian and Daoist thought - the Manifesto draws most directly from the Korean indigenous religion of Donghak.

Founded in 1860 by Choe Je-u (Suun) \parencite{Young2014-an}, Donghak itself was a reaction against two oppressive forces in Korean society. The first was the Neo-Confucian social order which imposed a strict hierarchy of inequality, similar to a caste system, in order to maintain social order. 
The second was the disruptive influence of Japan, China and the Western powers which were each competing for political and economic power on the Korean peninsula and which brought foreign ideas and Christian missionaries in service of their imperialist aims \parencite{Seong2020-cv, Young2014-an}.

Donghak, therefore was more than simply nationalistic in its rejection of western ideas, it was also a radically egalitarian challenge to Korea's contemporary mainstream Neo-Confucian values \parencite{Seong2020-cv}.
It promised a complete revolution in social values and power relations on the basis of the fundamental equality of all beings as the carriers of the universal and immanent divine spirit (\textit{jigi}) \parencite[p. 77]{Baek2017-gh}.
And this is why it was perceived as so threatening by the Josun ruling elites who executed both its founder and subsequently its second leader Choe Sihyeong (Haewol) \parencite{Young2014-an}.
It was Haewol who synthesised Donghak thought into a practical social spirituality that was so formative for the philosophy Hansalim's founders and especially for Jang Il-soon.


# Summary of Ethic: Interpersonal


In summary, the Manifesto presents the world as a living unity of nested unities that is spiritual, holistic, dynamic and permeated throughout with intentionality and consciousness.
It claims that all things bear divine life which unifies the cosmos as a living whole and connects human persons to one another and the wider world through relationships of mutual recognition, affirmation and care which respect the autonomy and relationality of persons.
While modern ethical frameworks are based almost solely on the concept of individual rights, and increasingly shaped by the post-modern invention of identity politics, Hansalim’s emphasis is on responsibility for oneself and others.
This does not mean, however, that the individual is subordinated to the will of the community.

# Explanation of Hansalim's name
The combination of these two words \textit{han} and \textit{salim} expresses the vision of Hansalim to save or to nurture all of life.
This would require a civilisation-wide transformation of cultural values, economic organisation and personal consciousness that would amount to what the Manifesto called 'the dawn of a new world embodying heaven'  (\textit{hu-cheon-gae-byeok} / 후천개벽 / 後天開闢) - \parencite[p. 101]{Hansalim2021-cy}.

# Quote from Kim Boyoung about the flow of the river

NI-01 
There’s a river near my parents’ house. That river might intersect with Highway 11, but when it hasn’t been maintained, it gets flooded when it rains heavily, and when the rain stops, the water recedes, and the river shifts left or right. The water flows back and forth. In areas like this, where the river isn't as large as the Han River, the riverbed becomes exposed. It's a sandy riverbed. Korea has many rivers made of sand, so the water flow changes slightly depending on how much soil the rain carries away. But I think that's the essence of life. The region where the river flows becomes fertile, and civilization develops accordingly. Seeing that life moves in this way, sometimes producers raise their voices, sometimes practitioners take the lead, and sometimes consumers take the lead. If these three organisations all raise their voices, everything will collapse, and if no one says anything, everything will collapse, and if only one organisation takes the lead, everything will collapse. But I think that this constant flow is necessary for life to exist.

# Quote from Kim Boyoung about discussing

NI-01
Answers: [00:58:16] As a result of discussing these issues together and fighting fiercely, we were able to put our plans into practice. Based on my experience in the community, I want to continue to spread the message that the most important thing for our community members to do when participating in union activities is to support the conclusions that we have fought over. That’s actually really difficult. But when we talk together, maybe because there are many good people around me, they listen to such things. And I try to pay attention to that. However, when I took on this role, I realized there are such things. But when we convey decisions like, “We’ve made this decision,” it turns out to be different. In this case, the most common response is, “I didn’t agree, so I’ll oppose it.” If you want to do that, why do you gather together to discuss it? Just go away. You can't say that you discussed it. Even if we discussed it and came to a different conclusion, we discussed it together, and when we really agreed, we accepted it. But at some point, the flow changes again.

Answers: [00:58:16] 그런 부분에 함께 이야기하고 치열하게 싸우고 나온 결과는 함께 실천하는 그것만 잘 이루어지도록. 저도 지역에서 제가 경험했으니까 우리 지역에 있는 분들이 조합원활동할 때 우리가 제일 해야 될 것은 싸우고 나온 결론에 대해서는 같이 응원하는 것, 이거는 계속 알리고 싶어요. 그게 사실 되게 어려워요. 그런데 같이 이야기 하면 제 주변에 좋은 사람들이 많아서 그런지 그런 것들을 들어주더라고요. 그리고 그걸 보려고 노력하고요. 그런데  제가 이런 역할을 해보니 이런 것들이 있더라. 그런데 우리는 이런 결정을 했다, 이런 것들을 전달했을 때 또 그게 다르더라고. 그렇지 않으면 '나는 동의 안 했기 때문에 반대할 거야' 이게 제일 많거든요. 
그렇게 하려면 왜 의논을 같이 모여서 해요. 그냥 나가지.  의논을 했다라고 그건 얘기할 수 없거든요. 그것을 의논을 해서 나랑 다른 결론이 나왔어도 우리는 함께 의논하고 진짜 승복할 때는  승복하고. 그런데 그게 어느 시점이 되면 또 흐름이 바뀌더라고요.

# Expanding broken ones from farmers to others

At the time Hansalim was founded, it was the small-scale farmers who were the 'broken ones' but as Hansalim has matured and society has changed, it has become clear that there are now many other broken ones in both urban and rural areas who are suffering loneliness, poverty and sickness.
By expanding activities into the care sector, Hansalim is beginning to expand its reach to embrace such people.

# Life Coops and Producer Federations do this

The 30 Life Cooperatives and the 15 Producer Federations maintain a national federation to manage their shared business activities such as logistics, product development, marketing and purchasing, run the national-level activities of the Life Movement including publishing, research, food life education and policy advocacy and to provide support to the federation’s member organisations.

# Arendt place of appearance

This can be understood as the integration of Action into every aspect of Hansalim's operations through the creation 'spaces of appearance' in every possible context.
These are spaces in which "I appear to others as others appear to me"  \parencite[p. 200]{Arendt2018-dn}.; that is, "within a community of equals where everybody has the same capacity to act"  \parencite[p. 244]{Arendt2018-dn} and which is held together not by systems of sanction or reward, but by the "force of mutual promise" \parencite[p. 245]{Arendt2018-dn}.

# Quotes about meetings and discussion

The chair of directors of one of Hansalim's Life Coops (NI-04 - 00:11:22) put it this way:

\begin{displayquote}
    "As some have said in a crude way: Hansalim equals meetings. Nothing happens without a meeting and you are participating in many of them.
\end{displayquote}
And further (NI-04 00:29:37):

\begin{displayquote}
    Whether it is at a conference or in a conversation, we must all agree on the most important issues and work together toward a common goal. It is very difficult if only one person agrees, but if 100 people agree, we can move forward. I believe that our organization has the ability to achieve this.
\end{displayquote}
Speaking of her participation in the agricultural production committee one consumer representative explained that (NI-01 - 00:18:30):

\begin{displayquote}
    Through this process, I began to see what we might be missing. So, I became more sensitive to areas where misunderstandings could arise. Through this experience, I realized that we shouldn't avoid opposition, but rather view it as a way to check and balance each other. However, there are times when opposition arises just for the sake of opposing. So, while not everything is right, I still think we should approach it that way.
\end{displayquote}

# Activities of resistance

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hansalim’s food life education institute trains educators to teach children, students, elderly and marginalised groups about nutrition, food preparation, sustainability and ecology.
    \item Hansalim’s publishing house and research institute produce books and other materials telling the stories and history of the movement and its members as well as providing analysis and policy advice which helps to influence the wider public discussion about sustainable futures.
    \item Conferences and forums, online seminars, websites and blogs all contribute to spreading the message of the Life Movement.
    \item Festivals bring members together for feasting and celebration and provide an opportunity to engage with people who are not yet familiar with Hansalim.
    \item Finally, public protest also plays a big role in Hansalim’s efforts to change opinions among the wider public and policy makers.
\end{enumerate}

# Cut from Alterity and hospitality sub-section

This means that from its foundation until the present, Hansalim has tried to accommodate the needs and preferences of consumers and producers whose values may only align to a small degree with the movements' founders while providing education and assistance to encourage them to adopt more of Hansalim's shared Values and Practices.



To that end, consumption is linked as closely to production as possible through contract purchasing and collaborative price setting which aims to ensure 75 percent of the sale price is returned to the farmers themselves.
A centrally held production stabilization fund, contributed to by each producer community, offers some compensation to farmers facing crop loss (this is in addition to the nationalised agricultural insurance scheme available to all farmers).
This is essentially a mechanism to redistribute resources among producer communities according to need to cope with unpredictable weather, disease and pest damage.

in the creative action of building an alternative economy which engages as little as possible in the competitive market relations of contemporary capitalism.
Hansalim rejected no only the shareholder model of ownership but also the capitalist principles of market-based competition and consumption.
The former is an act of resistance against the 'one dollar, one vote' model of economic control by adopting the traditional cooperative model of 'one member, one vote'.
The latter is an act of resistance against the inequalities and injustices embedded in the capitalist market which externalises environmental and social costs and rewards the use of purchasing power to drive down input costs and wages to satisfy creditors.

Hansalim sought to create an alternative economy that is not driven by depersonalised transactions through the capitalist market but rather by the trust 


The activity of production is also democratised through the formation of producer communities who cooperate together.
By avoiding synthetic external inputs, producing their own seed, growing their own animal feed, and recycling wastes as inputs many producer communities are able to limit dependence on commercial suppliers and insulate themselves from volatile markets relative to conventional farmers.
Finally, to provide stable and secure livelihoods for producers, Hansalim has effectively turned the market upside down.
Instead of purchasing to match fluctuating demand and pushing the risk only producers, they purchase mostly on contract.
To make this work the Federation takes on the risk of a mismatch between supply and demand and plans ahead what quantity to produce based on preious years data and future projections.

However, Hansalim does not restrict producer communities from selling outside Hansalim.
This provides a lot of flexibility and allows a wide diversity of livelihood strategies for producer members who may sell exclusively through Hansalim or alternatively sell only a small percentage of their produce while selling the rest through other channels.
It also means that producer communities are not entirely dependent upon the federation for their livelihoods which adds an important level of resilience.

The result is a kind of hybrid system which provides a comprehensive alternative to the conventional supermarket for consumer members while providing varying degrees of integration for producer members depending on their preference.


restores the role of trust between people whose transactions express the mutual understanding that the goods provided and the money exchanged represent 

Changing the relationship between profit and investment. The funds to invest in capital for future development (vehicles, offices, shops) are integrated into each transaction rather than taken from profits after the fact.


The latter aim, however, exposes Hansalim to market forces by making a significant proportion of its income dependent upon changes in market conditions.
Thus, Hansalim's business model is not only vulnerable to rising costs of production, but also to price retail fluctuations, because a large portion of Hansalim's income is from sales in direct competition to other organic shops and supermarkets which have entered the organic food market in force in recent years.
Because Hansalim purchases most products on contracts at pre-set prices and quantities, it cannot adjust supply to respond to changes in demand.
Instead, it uses a centrally held price adjustment fund which is used to absorb price cuts and special offers on certain products to stimulate sales.
This fund is collected from a percentage of sales so as to effectively hedge against future changes in demand.

The tension between the ideals of alterity and hospitality - the desire to create a different economy while also seeking to continue functioning within the capitalist economy - creates an intense pressure on nearly every aspect of Hansalim's activities.
It is this challenge that has forced Hansalim to continue to adapt to the changing market and consumer preferences even while attempting to influence consumer behaviour and build solidarity between consumers and producers.
It is one of the reasons for Hansalim's rapid growth in consumer membership but also the cause of many difficulties in managing distribution and production, made even more challenging by the impact of climate change.
However, not only does Hansalim strive to provide food and other products as inclusively as possible, but it also uses funds from its economic activities to support a range of actions aimed at serving the public and community interests.

# Quote from Vision 30 report

==The true appearance of life is not fixed but is constantly generated and changed. In Hansalim's philosophy, this logic of "not so, yet so"(不然其然) is not only the perception of seeing the world, but also the basis for our actions and practices.==
%%생명의 역사가 진화의 역사이고, 그것이 가능했던 이유는 드러나는 모습 이면에 ‘그렇지 않은 모습’이 존재하기 때문입니다. 그렇지 않은 것이 어느 순간 드러남으로써 생성 변화를 추동해 왔기 때문에 진화할 수 있었던 것이지요. 생명의 참 모습은 고정되지 않고 끊임없이 생성 변화하는 데 있습니다. 한살림의 철학에서는 이런 ‘아니다, 그렇다(不然其然)’의 논리를 세상을 보는 인식뿐만 아니라 우리의 행위, 실천의 준거로 삼습니다.%%

 ==The moment we are neat and obsessed with 'this', all possibilities are ruled out. It's always open to possibilities other than this. Otherwise, evolution stops. In the work of establishing a vision for the future of Hansalim, we must also be able to use the "not so much" that is not revealed behind the present revealed appearance of Hansalim as a new dynamic. And it is important to live out the vision so much as you can, but not to dwell on the consequences, not to be confined (生而不有長而不宰, begotten but not owned, raised and grown, but not at will).==
%%우리가 ‘이거’라고 단정하고 집착하는 순간, 모든 가능성은 배제되어 버립니다. ‘이것이 아닌’ 다른 가능성을 늘 열어놓는 것이지요. 그렇지 않으면 진화가 멈춥니다. 한살림의 미래 비전을 세우는 일에서도 현재 한살림의 드러난 모습 이면에 드러나지 않은 ‘그렇지 않은 모습’을 새로운 동력으로 삼을 수 있어야 합니다. 그리고 그렇게 만들어진 비전을 최선을 다해 실천하되, 그 결과에 머물지 않는 것, 가두지 않는 것이 중요합니다(生而不有 長而不宰, 낳았으되 소유하지 않고, 키우고 자라게 했지만 마음대로 부리지 않는다).%%

==In 'The Universe in a Grain of Rice', we find a section where Teacher Mu Yu spoke of contradictory standards and principles about Hansalim.[^3] That's not a back-and-forth statement, but a but it should be read as advice on the logic of "not so, yet so", the philosophy of situations that loosen when you try to loosen up, the philosophy of Hansalim based on the philosophy of evolution, the philosophy of the situation that is supplely released when it is tightening and hardening.== (This is probably the same reason why there are so many different things about Jesus' words in the Bible.)

# The motivation for Su-un's teaching about sagehood

Su-un taught his approach as a rejection of the hypocrisy and formalism of contemporary Neo-Confucian society and as a means of making 'sagehood' - or unity with \textit{Hanul} - accessible to anyone regardless of education, social status or privilege.

# Filler from Governance section

Its distinctiveness can easily be missed, hidden as it were in plain view; the seemingly mundane and often frustrating activity of getting things done within a complex and apparently convoluted system.
On closer inspection, there are several aspects of Hansalim's structure and governance processes that look puzzling if viewed from the perspective of organisational efficiency but which give rise to three features of the movement which we argue have been crucial factors in its resilience.

# Volunteering and exchanges



 7) volunteer labour in solidarity with producers or in consumer-producer collaboration for charitable causes.


 # Conflict leading to multiplication



# Machine metaphor vs Life metaphor



## Not so yet so

It is expressed in the three concepts of hucheon-gaebyeok (후천개벽, 後天開闢, moo-we-ee-hwa (무위이화, 無爲而化) and bul-yeon-gi-yeon (불연기연 不然其然).
The first, hucheon-gaebyeok translates literally as "the dawn of a new world embodying heaven".
The Manifesto interprets this to mean that the dismantling of the old order of 'killing' and creation of a new order of 'life' cannot be achieved through forcing or violent revolution but through a creative and cooperative evolution described in the phrase "moo-we-ee-hwa".
This second phrase translates roughly as "change through non-action" or "action which does not seek to contrive or force anything".
This is interpreted to mean that, "as part of the natural, unforced evolutionary process of the universe, human evolution results from the awakening and observed practices of people carrying heaven within." \parencite[p. 102]{Hansalim2021-cy}.
However, it is understood not as a narrowly deterministic biological process but from the perspective of the cosmos as an evolving unity of microcosms and macrocosms.
Its evolution is a dynamic process of change from simplicity towards complexity and from disorder toward order; a paradoxical relationship between the '"one" becoming "many"' and the '"many" becoming integrated as "one."' \parencite[p. 107]{Hansalim2021-cy}.
The interaction of these two energies gives rise to the continuing processes of self-transcendence and self-organisation through which "all levels of life transcend the limitations of their existence and extend forward..." and "driven by agitations, organize themselves into a new order."  \parencite[p. 107]{Hansalim2021-cy}.

Unlike the Hegelian or Marxian dialectic it is not a deterministic evolution driven by the logic of the synthesis of opposites or the self-realisation of Geist as the progress of history .... Idealist logic or materialist logic...
Instead, it is a creative evolution that unfolds through an epistemological logic of bul-yeon-gi-yeon or "not so, yet so".

Commenting on the Donghak scripture, Kim and Yoon \parencite{Kim2007-sv} explain this concept as follows:%quote-ICA

"According to Suun, we usually live in the phenomenal world of ordinary experience, which is \textit{giyeon}. However, ultimately and in the deepest level of our being we live in the world of \textit{buryeon}, which lies beyond the realm of the ordinary sense experience." \parencite[p. 72]{Kim2007-sv}.


This sets up a contradiction between appearance and becoming, Wirkweld and Merkweld, nature naturans and nature natura.... that is resolved by reference to a transcendent reality, Hanul.

# Machine metaphor vs Rice metaphor and buryeon giyeon

The alternative metaphor to the machine in the mechanistic world view is the symbol of a bowl of rice. Which represenets the real connection between prodution and consumption, humanity and nature etc. The bowl of rice is not just a different symbol but also works as a metphor in a differnt way to the machine metaphor. The machine metaphor is a 1:1 representation of the universe in a static relationship to its metaphorical symbol (in the mode of giyeon) while the bowl of rice is not meant as a 1:1 representation but as a node or a kind of singularity in which all the connections in the cosmos come together (thus it is a metphorical symbol in the mode of bujyeon).

# Balancing constituting power and constituent power

Pitfalls of too little hierarchy and structure vs too much. On the one hand, bullying and de facto rule by personality, on the other hand bureaucracy and rule by no-one. Finding a balance between constituting power and constituted power.
Hierarchy and structure places limits but, also by those limits, creates capacity for power to be created among equals rather than the force of some to constrict the power of all.

# Burmiester's mistaken assessment of the potential for civil society in Kroea


"In South Korea, the likelihood of rapid development of a robust civil society69 in rural areas in the post-authoritarian period must be treated with some skepticism.70 In the context of a Confucian local political culture that values  consensus  building  within  the  confines  of  a  morally  integrated community over and above the promotion of group affiliations based on common  self-interest71  and  in  the  social  context  of  extreme  sectoral homogeneity, post-liberation bureaucratic-authoritarian regimes were able to  redeploy  organizational  infrastructure  developed  during  the  colonial period to harness agriculture to the national development project and to manipulate the sector politically on clientelist terms. This was not fertile social terrain for the development of a robust, autonomous associational life.  Those  counterhegemonic  organizations  that  did  develop  (e.g.  farm organizations  affiliated  with  religious  groups  like  the  Catholic  Farmers Organization)  were  not  able  to  generate  what  Gramsci  might  term  an ‘organic,’  farmer-based  leadership  with  organizational  resources  that ‘pluralized’ the organizational field." \parencite[132]{Burmeister1999-gt} Turned out to be wrong didn't he!!


# What has Hansalim contributed?

The complexity and the diversity of Hansalim creates a lot of extra work. But its outcomes include a lot more than just higher incomes for farmers and some social connections. It has created hundreds of books and other publications of rich research and inspiring narrative. It has trained thousands of educators and activists. It influenced changes in government policy, created a national movement and numerous spinoff coops. It has transformed many individuals and communities in profound ways.
I believe it is Its complexity and diversity is the key to its creativity and resilience.
5.
6. This is why the role of practitioners in Hansalim is so important and why they should be paid more and given plenty of holiday to recharge from all their frustration performing all the extra work created by Hansalim’s maximal solution.


# Conclusion type paragraph

We can no longer think about social development or sustainable development in the reductionist terms handed down to us by materialism and empiricism.
Instead, we need to ask the more fundamental questions about what it means to be human in a world that is alive and in continuous motion.
And therefore, what forms of human flourishing can we aspire to that will be regenerative and nurturing to all life rather than destructive and degrading.
It is time for the cooperative movement to get philosophical and as GOEL founder says, discover a practical ethic that does not simply begin and end with economic and social indicators, but ....
It has grown out of its Utopian Socialist roots but has not yet found another source of inspiration besides the empiricist heritage of the enlightenment and the mechanistic Newtonian worldview.
Perhaps Hansalim's philosophy offers some new inspiration.


# What Hansalim is not


In the light of all this, Hansalim should probably be thought of, not simply as a cooperative, but as a social and ecological movement, an experiment in grassroots deliberative democracy.
So it is important to challenge some assumptions the people might bring to understanding Hansalim as an organization.
Firstly, from the perspective of an alternative food system, it is not a stable or static model.
As Hansalim has expanded in response to the growing organic food market in Korea, it has experienced many changes in structure and policy.
It has had to adapt to the changing scale of production and distribution operations as well as cultural and economic changes in Korea.
So it very much a food system in a constant process of adaptation rather than a stable model that can be copied to another context.

Secondly, it is also important to recognize that Hansalim is not really a single organization but a federation made up of a wide diversity of autonomous communities and associations, each with their own distinct histories and values.

Finally, it is not an exclusive movement but is actually inclusive of different farming philosophies from low-input conventional methods through to organic and integrated farming systems.
And in terms of participation of farmers, they range from being more or less dependent on Hansalim for their livelihoods.
For example some farmers will supply only to Hansalim while others may supply a portion of their produce to Hansalim while selling the rest through other channels.
Hansalim contains a whole diversity of examples that lie closer or further away from the ideal.

# Conclusion type paragraph

Hansalim has developed and survived within a hostile food system built on simplifying and uniformity to achieve efficiency and provide a consistent experience to consumers. Hansalim has achieved the same consistent experience but with radical enhancements with a system that is not at all based on simplicity, uniformity or efficiency. That in itself is remarkable. But Hansalim has done much more than simply create supermarkets.

# Summary of Life Cooperativism

If we modified the features of New Cooperativism according to what we now understand of Hansalim's Life Cooperativism we could answer question 1 as follows.
Their purpose would be defined in terms of personal, economic and cultural transformation towards peace and mutual flourishing of all life, human and nonhuman.
Their ethic would be defined in terms of a spiritual (non-materialist) worldview, mutual care grounded in respect for the intrinsic dignity of all, and a conscious balancing of individual and group needs.
Their political-economic orientation would be neither revolutionary nor reformist, not seeking to 'destroy capitalism' but to offer a functional alternative which nevertheless maintains an interface with the market against which it stands and enables a self-giving generosity towards 'outsiders.'
Their approach to multi-stakeholder governance will make room for personal joyful interactions, the cultivation of power through face-to-face encounter and embrace conflict as a central facet of multi-stakeholder cooperation rather than pursue purity of ideology.

# Methodology

The initial research design set out an in-depth explorative case study including elements of participatory observation, interviews, archival and desk research supplemented by engagement and collaborative research with researchers from Hansalim's Mosim and Salim Research Institute.
However, through the course of the project, the research method evolved beyond the initial design into an approach which, in retrospect, we characterise as a process of \textit{triple estrangement}.

The notion of estrangement (or defamiliarisation) has become a topic of discussion in ethnographic method as the counterpart to immersion \parencite[]{de-Jong2013-qv}.
It is argued that, while immersion is important for the 'thinking-from-within' \parencite[]{Shotter2006-tx} that is required to gain an insider perspective, distancing is also necessary in order to preserve 'a constant urge to problematize, to turn what seems familiar and understandable upside down and inside out' (\cite[p. 73]{Czarniawska-Joerges1992-sb}, cited in \cite[]{de-Jong2013-qv}) and to maintain an ongoing experience of surprise \parencite[]{de-Jong2013-qv}.
Ethnographic method has developed techniques for estrangement or distancing, particularly in organisational ethnography, to help the researcher maintain a critical outsider perspective while immersed in the day-to-day lives of the researched.
While keeping its core meaning intact we use the concept more broadly to describe a distinctive methodological approach which is not specifically ethnographic and which deploys elements of both immersion and distancing as parts of an emergent research process.
In this sense, we apply the concept to cross-cultural case study research of social movements and organisations as cases of collective action and transformative agency.
For this purpose, estrangement refers to a movement of perception from misplaced familiarity (seeing the case superficially through the lens of our own cultural and personal experience) through (de)familiarisation towards a critical understanding of both the familiarity and the strangeness of the object of study and our own cultural context.
This process is focused on both knowledge and communication, aimed not only at acquiring a rich understanding of the case but also at making it comprehensible to others from within or beyond the cultural context of the researcher themself.

As a research method for cross-cultural case study research we describe \textit{triple estrangement} as a three phase iterative process of (de)familiarisation resolved in a final integrative synthesis.
Stage one, \textit{\textbf{simple estrangement}}, entails entering an unfamiliar cultural context in which one feels estranged from the case and is required to move towards familiarization with the case to gain an emic or 'insider' perspective.
The second stage, \textit{\textbf{reflexive estrangement}}, involves estrangement from one's own cultural context as one reflects back on it from the new perspective of familiarity with the case.
This brings the emic perspective on the case into conversation with a newly acquired etic 'outsider' perspective on the contrasting, and previously familiar, home context.
This helps to highlight the distinctive features of the case while also identifying the similarities with one's own context and to provide a context for critical engagement with one's own context.
The third stage is \textit{\textbf{vicarious estrangement}} in which one tries to explain one's understanding of the case to others who are themselves unfamiliar with it and who share neither one's own culture nor the culture of the research object.
This three stage process provokes a deeper and more critical understanding of the case, generating a fresh post-immersion etic perspective on the case which can be placed alongside the emic perspective and prompts questions that the researcher would not have otherwise thought of.
It also reveals the gaps in understanding and areas of disconnect which hinder communication of the case to those who do not share the researcher's own direct experience of it.
It is these disconnects which the final synthesis aims at bridging.
The final \textit{\textbf{integrative resolution}} brings together insights from the journey of \textit{triple estrangement} with concepts from relevant literatures from within and outside the cultural context to 'close the gap' by integrating these perspectives into a synthesis with relevance for both insider and outsider readers.

\subsection{The research process}

Below we describe the research process undertaken by the lead author, while the co-author participated throughout as a guide and conversant, drawing on their experience of working as a Mosim researcher and their subsequent PhD and post-doc research on the history of the Korean cooperative movement.

The first phase of the research process, \textit{simple estrangement}, began with Korean language study and primary qualitative and desk-based research which was supported by a series of regular seminars and one-to-one discussions with Mosim researchers and the paper's co-author.
This process generated a set of questions to include in the interview protocols for each type of interview.
These questions and interview protocols were reviewed and revised in collaboration with Mosim researchers and the co-author and translated into Korean while interview participants were selected through a combination of selecting expert interviewees and snowball sampling.

The \textit{reflexive estrangement} phase involved an iterative process of interviewing, reading and reflecting which spanned from September 2022 through June 2023.
By simultaneously engaging with English language literature on cooperativism, ecophilosophy and political science, discussing with Mosim researchers and conducting and analysing the interviews, the author was able to identify key questions and gain deeper insight into the distinctiveness of Hansalim's evolution.
During this time the lead author conducted 31 qualitative semi-structured interviews with various Hansalim stakeholders including 15 consumer representatives, 5 activists, 15 employees/practitioners, 18 producers, and 2 founders in various parts of the country from Seoul to Jeju.
These were recorded, transcribed by Sonix.ai and finally proof read and organised by a native speaking research assistant to extract the answer text relevant to the interview questions.
The extracted answer material from each interview was then translated using DeepL and coded according to the interview themes using Atlas.ti.
The list of interviews can be seen in table \ref{interviews} below.

The third phase of fieldwork, \textit{vicarious estrangement}, took the form of a study tour of European countries to present about Hansalim and listen to feedback from interested parties in these different cultural and socio-economic contexts.
Between the 21st August and 9th September 2023 the lead author travelled to Germany, Norway, Denmark, Austria and Italy to meet practitioners, producers and researchers involved with solidarity-based organic food initiatives to not only describe the case of Hansalim but also to learn about efforts at creating alternative food systems inspired by similar goals as those of Hansalim.
The learnings from this study tour were presented to the Mosim and Salim Rearch Institute and to Hansalim stakeholders at a meeting of the Hansalim Federation's Board of Directors.
The final stage in this phase of fieldwork was a study tour by four European practitioners to Hansalim in May 2024, organised by the lead author in partnership with Mosim researchers.
This phase of work raised further questions beyond those asked through the previous two phases.
These questions reached to the heart of what 'outsiders' wanted to know about Hansalim that would be of use to them in their own contexts and also touched on how Hansalim's example could be made comprehensible to readers who were saturated in euro-centric thought styles and historical awareness.

The final phase of research, \textit{integrative resolution}, brought together the findings from the previous phases of fieldwork with these further questions and sought to synthesise an understanding of Hansalim in its context.
The aim of this synthesis was to communicate Hansalim's philosophy and evolution in such a way as to not collapse the difference and otherness of Hansalim while making it accessible and relatable to the knowledge and experience of outsiders.
This process involved close reading of Western literature on cooperatives and political philosophy alongside a review of archival and contemporary material describing the theoretical, philosophical and historical inspiration of Hansalim's founders.

# Research Question 1

Defining NC in terms of these four dimensions supports two complementary paths of inquiry -- one categorical and the other relational -- both of which are necessarily Value laden.
The first, the categorical enquiry, is to clarify the edges of the NC concept.
Each dimension provides a conceptual space upon which to draw the borders between what might or might not be considered appropriate to NC.
The question of how to determine the hierarchy of Values upon which to base our judgments and who gets a say in these decisions is a vital one which the four dimensions framework forces to the surface.
It answers the question: how could Hansalim's experience provoke an expanded definition of the Values of NC?

# Research Question 2 & 3

The second, the relational enquiry, is to plumb the depths of NC.
Each dimension acts as a node linking to a network of associated and interconnected Resources and Practices many of which are antagonistic to the Values we bring to NC while some are resonant and complementary.
Exploring the possible pathways through these networks opens up a divers palette of colours with which to paint a richer picture of how NC could mature into its own multifaceted but coherent identity characterised by shared Values and Practices.
It answers the question: what Resources for transformative change are provided by Hansalim for the development of NC? And what lessons can we draw from Hansalim's practices which are relevant to other contexts?

# Park Quote

\textcite{Pak2016-nd} highlight the uniqueness of Hansalim in this respect:

\begin{displayquote}[{\cite[p. 17]{Pak2016-nd}}][]

we know of no other instance of an intellectual movement aimed at formulating as comprehensive an ecophilosophy for the modern times as \textit{Hansalim} or one that has been able to play as extensive a role in practical terms. In fact, Hansalim can be said to have been a living experiment in how to formulate an ecophilosophy that is relevant and practical for today's world.

\end{displayquote}

# Titlted balance

This seems to be what Yoon means by 'tiltled balance' which was originally defined by Kim Ji-ha in relation to Hansalim's journey:

\begin{displayquote}[{\cite{Kim2002-xg}}]
    "The philosophy of ‘tilted balance', along with paradoxes, is crucial to understanding life. However, the term ‘tilted balance' does not adequately describe the world of life. That is, the adjective ‘tilted' and the noun ‘balance', which denote states, do not capture the dynamism of the ever-changing world of life. The world of life is constantly tilting and tumbling rather than being in a stable balance."
\end{displayquote}

This connects with Kolakowski's claim that "dissatisfaction is the sole source of cultural creativity in all its realms."
And subsequent observation that "the ideally conflictless society assumes a situation in which individuals have been deprived of all possibility of choice and therefore also of creativity. The creative possibility is thereby removed from society as a whole." \cite[p. 101]{Kolakowski2001-in}
If we accept this statement, then the only conclusion that can be drawn is that, for a community such as Hansalim to survive in a changing socio-political-economic environment, it must remain creative and therefore has no choice but to face conflict head on.
Kim Ji-ha further explains the necessary attitude with which to face this conflict and navigate the evolving tilted balance which is the source of future creativity which he derives from the Confucian doctrine of the mean (中庸):

\begin{displayquote}[{\cite{Kim2002-xg}}]
    "A more precise expression of this spirit is the term shijung (discernment - 时中), which appears in 'The Doctrine of the Mean', the second of the Four Books, written by Confucius's grandson Zisi (子思). It means to strike a balance in an ever-changing situation. This kind of person is called a virtuous person. A person who is principled, but is also able to make judgements and adjust their behaviour according to the time and situation."
\end{displayquote}

Why should discernment in this sense (and, by implication, moderation) be central the idea of a 'tilted balance'; an unstable and ever-changing creative flow?
Here again, Kolakowski provides a helpful insight when he suggests that "the values of my culture cannot be jointly implemented and kept intact...".
The implication of this claim is that:

\begin{displayquote}[{\cite[p. 22]{Kolakowski2001-in}}]
    "An overwhelming proportion of my acts consists of compromises in which a partial or fragmentary saving of a value occurs at the expense of saving it as a whole, and this loss is incurred in order partially to save another value... The degree of acceptable compromise -- the extent of possible abandonment of a partial actualization of a value for the sake of another value -- is not clearly defined by the norms of my culture. And this indeterminacy is the greater, the greater is the potential of my culture's flowering."
\end{displayquote}

This observation captures the root of Hansalim's creativity as a movement.
The bringing together of the Values of the Life Movement (as laid out by the founders) and the Values of those existing and joining members from rural and urban areas and multiple socio-economic backgrounds into a shared democratic endeavour generates an unusually high level of indeterminacy over what constitutes an acceptable compromise among this great diversity of Values.
This is one of the fundamental differences between single-stakeholder and multi-stakeholder cooperation.
While the former bundles like-minded people together around a single interest, the latter weaves together often differently-minded people around a shared project to which they each bring a different set of interests, some of which are aligned while others are not.
Navigating the conflicts this generates and finding acceptable compromises requires a certain degree of moderation and discernment without which the only way forward would be to exclude anyone who doesn't fit.

One producer member explained:

\begin{displayquote}[{NI-05 00:41:12}]
    "However, unlike corporate organizations, Hansalim is a cooperative organization where members express their opinions on all matters, so it is possible that they come up with the best alternatives. But there are also cases where this is not the case. That is why some people are a little dogmatic, thinking that only they are right or that something is absolutely right. So, when I can express my opinion at Hansalim, I don't just say, "No, that's not right." Even if it's still a minority opinion, we discuss it through all-night debates until we reach a unanimous decision, and I think that's a very good thing."
    %Answer: [00:41:12] 그렇지만 그 한살림이 그 기업조직하고 달리 그 서로 모든 사안에 대해서 이렇게 서로 의견을 내고 협동조합조직이다 보니까 그런 것들이 사실상 최선의 대안을 내고 그럴 수도 있지만. 그렇지 못한 부분이 있단 말이에요. 그래서 지금 그 일각에서는 약간 교조적인 그러니까 나만 옳다 내지는 이것이 절대적으로 옳다. 어떤 그런 종류의 어떤 가치관 제안을 많이 하는 경우도 있어요. 그래서 그렇지만 한살림에서 내가 어떤 의견을 낼 수 있을 때 그게 '아, 이게 아니다'라고 얘기지 않고 그게 지금까지도 그 소수의견 이지만 거의 밤샘토론을 통해서라도 만장일치로 의견을 모으고 하는 그런 부분이 상당히 좋다고 판단을 하죠. 
\end{displayquote}

A similar sentiment was expressed by a consumer member of a joint producer-consumer committee:

\begin{displayquote}[{NI-01 00:18:37}]
    'One of the most difficult things, both now and in the future, is that everyone joined Hansalim for different reasons. I also have my own personal reasons, but since the direction we are pursuing is not clearly explained, everyone ends up talking about what they want. Then, we often forget what we are really doing here… Through this experience, I realized that instead of avoiding opposition, we need a perspective that allows us to see things together and check each other. However, there are also times when opposition arises just for the sake of opposing. So, while not everything is perfect, I think we should still try to do it this way."
    %김보경 : [00:18:37] 지금도 그렇고 뒤에도 이야기 할 지 모르겠지만 가장 어려운 것들 중 하나가 각자 한살림에 들어온 이유가 다 달라요. 저도 개인적인 이유가 또 다른 것처럼 그런데 우리가 추구하는 방향은 제대로 설명되어 있지 않은 상황이니까 내가 원하는 것만 이야기 다들 하게 되거든요. 그러면 진짜 여기가 뭐하는 곳인지 잊어 버리게 되는 경우가 종종생기게 되더라고요.… 그런 경험을 해보니까 이게 반대라고 피할 것이 아니라 같이 보면서 견제하는 시각도 필요하다고 생각하고 대신, 반대를 위한 반대도 나올 때도 있어요. 그래서 다 맞는 건 아니지만 그래도 우리가 그렇게 해야하지 않을 까 생각해요.
\end{displayquote}


# Relating Hansalim to Donghak

One of the central insights that shaped the entire ethos of the Hansalim movement was the observation that industrial civilisation was creating a kind of totalitarian technocracy which anonymised and objectivised all beings into what they called 'bundles' such that the concrete life of each individual was erased (Vision 30). The heart of this criticism is the claim which is common to many similar critiques that, as Thomson et al. put it: "first, that capitalism instrumentalises all that it touches, including most obviously both work and consumption and, second, that it is driven by an imperative to encroach upon an ever-increasing number of aspects of human life, as we see in its neoliberal phase. The machine has a need to constantly grow and everything it touches becomes part of the machine." \cite{Thomson2021-hz} (p. 174). %note-paper-3

However, the manifesto not only critiqued capitalism but also rejected the socialist alternative as equally guilty of driving the destructive progress of industrial civilization which devalued humans as if they were mere parts in a machine and exploited nature as something to be dominated and consumed in the pursuit of economic growth. They argued that industrial civilization is built upon a false mechanistic model of reality that arose from Western philosophy's atomistic view of the material and social worlds [@Hansalim1990-jb]. As a remedy, they proposed a vision for a new future of cooperation between peoples and between humanity and the non-human world based on the values and worldview of an indigenous Korean religion called Donghak (東學 'Eastern Learning', later renamed Chondogyo or 'Heavenly Way').%quote-ICA


The optimism of this vision might seem naive were it not for the fact that it was articulated by people who had experienced the suffering of the Korean war, the fracturing of their nation into two halves and decades of struggle against brutal oppression by a military dictatorship.
For this reason, the Manifesto's rejection of dehumanising political strategies in favor of non-violent resistance and peacemaking through reconciliation can be seen not as being idealistically Utopian but as an unflinchingly courageous realism expressed by those who have seen first hand the failure of divisive politics and class conflict.%notes-paper-1




\subsubsection{Hansalim Manifesto}



\subsubsection{Donghak}

Donghak was founded by a poor scholar named Suun Choe Je-u in 1860 in Joseon (Korea) [@Young2014-an]. In the Donghak scripture the _Nonhak-Mun_ [@Kim2007-sv, p. 8-9] Suun writes that the Divine Spirit (or Hanullim) told him "My mind is your mind" (曰吾心即汝心也) which is interpreted to express the true nature of humanity as bearers of Divine Life [@Seong2020-cv]. Suun is given an incantation by Hanullim which is the means for receiving the Divine Spirit (靈) and practicing the Way.%quote-ICA

In their translation of the Donggyeong Daejeon (Great Scripture of Eastern Learning), Kim and Yoon provide a translation and explanation of Suun's incantation as follows:%quote-ICA

> "_Jigigeumji weonwi daegang_ (至氣今至願爲大降) which means "I pray for the great descent of the Ultimate Energy now," is the technique of receiving the Spirit, which is actually the first part of the Incantation; _Si cheonju johwa jeong_ (侍天主造化定), which means "God is within us and all are made well," is the second part of the Incantation; and _yeongse bulmang mansaji_ (永世不忘萬事知), which means "eternally not forgetting and being aware of all things," is the poem of "Not Forgetting (God)," which is the last part of the Incantation. The entire Incantation consists of twenty-one Chinese characters." [@Kim2007-sv, p. 79]%quote-ICA

The incantation encompasses the central teaching of Donghak that the Hanullim (or God) is in all things and therefore humans also bear God within them. However, through selfishness and negative outside influences, people have forgotten this truth that they are fundamentally one with God and habitually act in opposition to the Way. This is the cause of human suffering and evil. To recover oneness with God one needs to cultivate the mind of God within oneself and to act justly towards others (Susim Jeonggi 守心正氣) [@Kim2007-sv, p. 70]. As people cultivate this 'Heavenly Way' then a new world begins to dawn, a 'kingdom of heaven on earth' which will ultimately come to encompass the whole cosmos, not through violent revolution but by natural becoming.%quote-ICA

Seong, reflecting on the ethical relationalism of Donghak notes that: %quote-ICA

> “each individual action, when seen from this point of view, is a movement of the infinite Hanullim confirming the eternity of the self and the whole within the infinite Hanullim. When I am forming a relationship with Hanullim, other people or things, I must treat (侍，事， 食）them as Hanullim; that is when the actions within these dual relationships become an action within the infinite Hanullim.” (Seong 2020, 8).%quote-ICA

For Suun, the Heavenly Way can be found only through a particular way of knowing which he calls _buryeon giyeon_ (不然其然) which can be translated as "not so (buryeon), yet so (giyeon)". Kim and Yoon [@Kim2007-sv] explain this concept as follows:%quote-ICA

> "According to Suun, we usually live in the phenomenal world of ordinary experience, which is _giyeon_. However, ultimately and in the deepest level of our being we live in the world of _buryeon_, which lies beyond the realm of the ordinary sense experience." [@Kim2007-sv, p. 72].%quote-ICA

These and other ideas from Donghak were later taken up in the Hansalim Manifesto and form the core values of the Hansalim movement and the federation of cooperatives at its heart.%quote-ICA

How could such an apparently naive and idealistic vision emerge and be implemented under such hostile conditions of rapid industrialisation and mass unrest in Korea during the 1980s? What were its effects on Korean society and what are the implications for how we think about the future role of state, private and civil society sectors in  transformations towards sustainability?
These are the questions this paper seeks to answer.

\subsubsection{Hansalim style democracy}

# ICA talk

### Cooperation with the non-human world

In particular, the Manifesto describes food as an offering to oneself as Hanullim which should be received with gratitude to nature and the people who collaborated with nature to obtain it. Thus, eating is seen as an act of unity with the whole of life and symbolic of the cooperation between the whole of human society and the non-human world. That food is a contribution to life made by the labor of others in cooperation with Hanullim in nature and received by the one who eats. The concept of prayerful eating reframes eating as a pledge of gratitude to feed back what one has received from Hanullim, the land and ones neighbors. And central to expressing this gratitude is finding ways to nurture divine life in the world around you including the human and non-human world.%quote-ICA

I see this principle expressed in Hansalim's approach to agriculture and in this way, cooperation is seen as a practice involving not just humans but also nature as equal participants.%quote-ICA

My final question is whether there is something we can learn from Suun about how to intentionally cultivate the creative interplay between these two logics of cooperation. I think there is a clue in the concept of _buryeon giyeon_ that I mentioned earlier.%quote-ICA


\subsubsection{The Work of Silence}

I interpret  _buryeon_ and _giyeon_ to be equivalent to the two ways of knowing described by Maggie Ross in 'Silence: A User's Guide'. Writing from a background in Christian theology she presents the 'work of silence' in terms that invoke scientific evidence alongside the insights of religious contemplative traditions, claiming:%quote-ICA

> "If we are to recover our balance -- and our humanity -- we need to unblock the flow of communication between the limited world of our self-consciousness that is linear, finite, two-dimensional, static, and dead, and our core silence -- our deep mind -- that is global, infinite, dynamic, and multi-dimensional." [@Ross2014-ci, p. 14].%quote-ICA

It is the 'work of silence', the elision of self-conscious reflexive perception, that opens the way to deep mind (_buryeon_) by subverting the linear, analytical thinking of the self-conscious mind and bringing us to rest in an altogether different state of self-forgetful awareness that lies beyond the access of perception or experience [@Ross2014-ci; @Laird2006-vl]. I think that what _buryeon giyeon_ is describing as the heart of Suun's Heavenly Way is fundamentally the same principle expressed by Ross: the integration of and flow of communication between these two ways of knowing, the self-conscious linear or discursive mind (_giyeon_) and the self-forgetful spacious deep mind (_buryeon_). With this in view, Suun's incantation, meditation, prayer, cultivating the mind of Hanullim, acting rightly or justly -- all are elements of this work of silence in Suun's Heavenly Way.%quote-ICA

The organizational logic that I described above is clearly  rooted in  _giyeon_ -- the linear discursive mind -- while the relational logic is rooted in _buryeon_ -- the deep mind. The organizational logic deals with what can be categorized, defined and controlled while the relational logic refers to what is ultimately indescribable, invisible and uncontrollable. The two pull apart in constant tension, the one constantly driven by the need to control the other while the other reacts violently against any hint of control. What the writings of Maggie Ross and many others suggest is that this conflict can only be brought into a creative interplay through the work of silence, which is to say through the daily practices of 'guarding the mind' (e.g. meditation or prayer) and acting justly (e.g. practicing virtues such as kindness, gentleness, openness, self-restraint). These can just as easily be non-religious as religious practices, but either way they must be rooted in an ethical framework that values human and non-human life such as the one that Donghak describes. So perhaps a deepening cooperative identity lies somewhere in the synergy between  1) organizational form, 2) relational connection, and 3) the work of silence holding the two together in creative motion.%quote-ICA

In practical terms this means finding ways to regularly slow down, be still and allow the discursive mind to fade away for a while and re-enter the world of _buryeon_ or deep mind. Meditate, make art and music, sing together, go hiking alone and together. From this place of stillness we can then begin to reflect on what we are doing. We make room for people's spiritual and emotional needs to be expressed and met alongside economic ones. We consider how organizational structures and processes are hindering or enabling relational connections. It means measuring performance not simply in terms of organizational goals but in terms of individual transformation as well. It means making opportunities for playing together, sharing personal stories, lots of listening to one another and eating with one another. It means learning to communicate more carefully and intentionally, for example using tools such as Non-violent communication (which I mentioned in the extended abstract for this talk). It means thinking about the role of those who are indirectly connected to the cooperative such as children and elderly relatives. And it means taking the time to collectively work out shared values and understand the needs, aspirations and fears of everyone involved in the shared journey of become more fully human.%quote-ICA

\subsubsection{Some more ways Hansalim does this work of silence}


# Temporary cut from 'Discussion' section

In answering these questions it is important to recognise that most (perhaps all) of these Values and Practices cannot not be directly transposed to other contexts without severing them from their foundations in Hansalim's unique cultural-historical Resources.
Neither can they be used as a set of general principles to define a model or organisational blueprint for others seeking to build something similar.
They can, however, serve as a compass, to help others to find their own paths towards similar destinations, starting as they are, from different places and with different Resources.

How does your purpose address long-term global trends, present local socio-economic needs and the challenges faced by the individual in modern society?Hansalim provides an answer to this question appropriate to the historical trajectory of Korean society but also with an eye to global political, social, economic and environmental trends.The advantage of contextualising a purpose in an integrated way from the personal, through the local and national to the global sphere is that it broadens the basis for cooperation beyond local environmental or economic interests.By encompassing a huge diversity of issues important to people from various backgrounds and scales of interest and integrating them into a concern for global civilisation the potential for mobilisation is multiplied.

The second is to assert the metaphysical foundations for your Values (moral rather than simply instrumental).One of the weaknesses of Cooperativism (and possibly New Cooperativism too) is the various influences of modernist and postmodernist worldviews which sidestep the question of existence as such and therefore nullify all basis for defining anything but relative values.The assumption of empiricism that existence is an arbitrary brute fact, inexplicable by any greater source of meaning, forces us to try to live by the self-contradictory utilitarian claim: "This is not a value but I believe it to be a value" since it is useful to the continued functioning of society \textbackslash{}cite[p. 23]\{Kolakowski2001-in\}.Instead, as Kolakowski argued, "both the justification of my own identity and the justification of the human community, by referring it to the common environment of objects, requires the mythical option which is contained in accepting the category of existence in a nonconditional sense" \textbackslash{}cite[p. 17]\{Kolakowski2001-in\}.It is this 'mythical option', a recovery of metaphysical thought, which Hansalim has shown to be effective in building a movement for social change which is resistant to cooption into purely economic projects.We should not shy away from asking ourselves, on what basis do I claim a moral and ethical stance?Is this basis enough to undergird a set of universal obligations which can accommodate the diverse beliefs of others via an agreed hierarchy of Values to guide our collaboration?

Third, know your theory of change.Margaret Atwood writes, "That's always a problem when sweeping utopian changes are proposed: What do you do about those who don't agree with you?" Is it true, she asks, "that better for some always means worse for others? Or are there indeed some forms of positively intended change that make things better for everyone?"She goes on to pose the question "What kind of story do we think we're in?"The answer to this question will determine the bases for our theory of change and how we understand the type of transformation we seek to achieve.If we are living a story of heroes and revolution in which enemies are to be overthrown and systems destroyed our theory of change will most likely be shot through with violence, whether physical or not, and transformation will be achieved only at a high cost of hatred and destruction.If, on the other hand, our story is one defined by reconciliation and meaningful suffering and self-sacrifice our theory of change will be shaped by persistence, patience and love and transformation will be accompanied by an increase in our trust and confidence in one another.

Finally, plan from the start for the next generation.When attempting to create a democratic movement or organisation the temptation is to conecentrate on short-term success and rapid growth at the expense of longevity and long-term resilience.This can lead to a shortsighted focus on the founders and the first generation of leaders and members without considering what will be necessary to ensure the continuation of the endeavor by subsequent generations long after the founders are gone.How you plan for the next generation will depend upon your metaphor for politics as the process of motivating and shaping collective action.The nineteenth century conception of politics as making (which has been uncritically adopted by many modern movements) was shaped by the revolutions of 1848 and views people as "human material" to be crafted into some new form of social order by a "strong man" leader as one crafts dead matter into use objects \textbackslash{}cite[cf][p. 188, 228,]\{Arendt2018-dn\}.Such an approach might be successful while a charismatic founder or their successor holds sway but it is unavoidably associated with the use of force, however subtle, because it is the end which justifies the means.This substitution of making for action atrophies power as the potential for collective action.The contrasting virtues of a "strong man" leader -- charisma, self-confidence, single-mindedness, ruthlessness -- and those of their followers -- loyalty, obedience, self-sacrifice -- undermine the virtues necessary to for deliberative democracy.The metaphor of politics as an indeterminate and neverending process unfolding through a web of relationships (see Arendt) provides an alternative to politics as making.In this case it is not conceived of in terms of means and ends but rather in terms of collective Action shaped by the virtues of truthfulness, humility, courage, love and the capacities for promise-making and fogiveness.Action (including politics) is therefore the essential mode of our existance as plural individuals, the condition of being for humans as people.Governance structures, therefore, need to be desinged to facilitate this moode of being for as many as are willing to share it in perpetuity.As long as this context for interaction and collective action exists, the community exists.As soon as it dissappears or degenerates, the community is lost.

%\subsection{Metaphor}

%To answer question 2 -- about the Resources provided by Hansalim --  we can begin by trying to harvest the fruit they have born and plant the seeds of those fruit into other contexts where they will grow and mature, nourished by the Resources discoverable within their local cultural-historical milieu.
%We suggest that those fruit can be seen in the metaphors brought to bear by the Life Movement on the conditions of contemporary experience because it is these which will enable us to re-conceptualise what it is we are doing when we cooperate.
%As Lakoff and Johnson observed: "Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature" \parencite[loc. 99]{Lakoff2024-xm}.
%By reconsidering the metaphors we unconsciously adopt in our thinking and intentionally choosing alternative ones when necessary we will be able to open the doorway to new ideas and ways of being.

%Chief among the metaphors deployed by Hansalim is that of the 'universe in a bowl of rice' (a drawing of which actually features on many of Hansalim's publications).
%The symbol of a bowl of rice is given as an alternative metaphor to the machine in the mechanistic world view.
%However, the bowl of rice is not just a different symbol but also works as a metaphor in a different way to the machine metaphor.
%The machine metaphor is a 1:1 representation of the universe in a static relationship to its metaphorical symbol while the bowl of rice is not meant as a 1:1 representation but as a node or a kind of singularity in which all the connections in the cosmos come together.
%As such, it represents the very real, but hidden, connections between production and consumption, and between humanity and the rest of the living cosmos.
%Another metaphor is the grain of rice, or a sprouting seed (the logo of Hansalim), as a seed of \textit{Hanullim} which can be recognised and nurtured to life in all things and which transforms our understanding of Labour and Work at the acts of \textit{mosim} and \textit{salim} (service and nurturing).
%\textit{Poongryu} (or flowing wind) provides yet another metaphor, one of Action.
%In opposition to the traditional metaphor of political action as 'making' (the shaping of inert matter) it evokes the initiation of processes which flow in unpredictable and unforeseeable ways, directed by no-one but influenced by everyone.
%There are many others also, but these are enough to provide productive examples of how we can "think what we are doing." \cite[p. 4]{Arendt2018-dn}

%Second point is about looking for equivalent or resonant Resources in our own contexts.....




\subsection{Labour-Work-Action}

The final question -- what lessons can be drawn from Hansalim's Practices? -- raises the issue of translating culturally embedded forms of activity into other contexts.
It is obvious that Hansalim's Practices cannot be simply copied and replicated elsewhere.
Nevertheless, they can provide inspiration for contextualised equivalents which aim at similar combinations of Labour, Work and Action across the four dimensions.

The Practices of collective transformative learning, polysemic participation and transparent deliberation in Hansalim are strongly shaped by cultural and institutional factors such that their specific forms (e.g. training styles, rituals, meeting protocols, formal and informal hierarchies, methods for transparency, structures for deliberation) may appear quite unfamiliar to outsiders and not suitable for other contexts.
However, the emphasis on emotional connection, commitment to shared study, the principal of transparency, the requirement for structured deliberation, rules based procedures etc. can be reinterpreted in other contexts without undue difficulty.

For many of these Practices, however, there are of course already plentiful examples in most other contexts which could be considered equivalent.
For example, storytelling and intentional modification of terminology, Value-based trade and face-to-face communication, nurturing shared meals, agriculture and life are already part of solidarity-based food systems and New Coopertives to varying degrees.
Non-violent protest and policy advocacy are common activities of civil society organisations but pehaps not as strongly emphasised in NC as they are by Hansalim.
The distinctiveness of Hansalim, then, is to bring these various Practices together into the life of a single cooperative movement and organisation.

Through the Practice of Nurturing shared meals, agriculture and life, creating a comprehensive and flexible alternative economy, and commoning the Labour of food production, preparation and distribution is joined to the Work of forming the more permenant material environment (meeting spaces, farms, workplaces, canteens, gardens) which provide the concrete symbols of an enduring community connecting rural and urban worlds.
This is in stark contrast to the ephemeral structures implied by the vision of DisCO's as distributed, extremely online collectives.
Also part of this Work, is the reification of community identity through the artistic Practice of storytelling and the intentional use of language as not merely a means for communication but as forming the world of ideas and historical consciousness within which thinking and Action take place.

This 'world' of Hansalim, in turn hosts (physically and metaphorically) the myriad types of Action expressed in Value-based trade and face-to-face communication, collective transformative learning, polysemic participation, non-violent protest and policy advocacy, poongryu, Council democracy and transparent deliberation.
Labour, Work and Action are thus not seperated by a division of reponsibilities but form part of the experience of everyone involved according to their willingness to participate.
Cooperation thus involves not only collaborative Labour (production), Work (making) and Action but also brings all three together in the experience of all active members so that those who Labour, also participate in Work and Action, while those who Act and Work also particpate in Labour.
