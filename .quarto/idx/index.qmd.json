Now referred to as the Rochdale Pioneers, their practical response to the misery inflicted on the poor by the industrial revolution became a touchstone for a rapidly growing movement of working class people empowering themselves through cooperation and grassroots democracy.\nWhat began as a multitude of local practical answers to the worsening crises of capitalist industrialisation in Britain, France, Germany and beyond soon became an international movement of economic democratisation that transformed the lives and communities of countless peoples around the world.\nCredit unions, farmer, worker and consumer cooperatives grew into huge federations wielding significant economic power and which included women as equal voting members decades before women won the right to vote in national or local elections.\nThese cooperative organisations championed food safety and quality standards, fair prices, decent wages and working conditions and democratic management long before these ideas became part of mainstream conversation or legislation.\n\nThe modern cooperative movement that grew from these social innovations among the working classes in nineteenth century Britain and Europe is now a global movement encompassing around 12\\% of the world's population. \nRepresented by its own international organisation, the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA), the movement brings together a huge diversity of cooperative enterprises across almost all sectors of social and economic life.\nAs legal forms of organisation, cooperatives, credit unions and other types of mutual associations have become remarkably successful at providing economic stability for their members in the face of the recurring crises of global capitalism.\nThese successes, however, only partly reflect the original ambitions of the early cooperators, who dreamt of inspiring a complete transformation of society out of the chaos of contemporary capitalism and into a Utopian order of cooperation that would benefit the whole of humanity.\nNow that the UN and other international organisations have begun to reflect on the legacy and future of cooperativism from the perspective of environmental sustainability and social development, those earlier dreams of systemic change have taken on a new significance.\n\nThe present crises of climate and ecosystem breakdown, worsening pollution and socio-economic inequality and the rapid loss of trust in politics and institutions have prompted many to seek to recover the radical values of cooperativism and reinterpret them, often with a post-capitalist slant.\nTo provide a coherent framing for these efforts, the idea of 'New Cooperativism' has come to be used to refer to cooperative projects which emphasise common good orientation, multi-stakeholder participation, a transformative stance against the status quo and a commitment to participatory democratic governance.\n\nContemporary industrialised food systems involve the extravagant use of non-renewable energy and toxic inputs manufactured from rapidly depleting fossil fuels to produce highly processed foods that cause multiple negative impacts on human health, all while polluting the environment, degrading ecosystems, driving pandemic risk from zoonotic spillover, and generating massive quantities of greenhouse gases. Neither do farmers themselves derive any livelihood security from this arrangement but rather face a constant downward pressure on incomes that is made worse by the growing impacts of an unpredictable and increasingly volatile climate and market. It is perhaps only from within the boardrooms of multinational food companies and agribusiness that the twentieth century approach to food and farming appears remotely defensible. The only remaining justification for the status quo is the share prices of profit-driven companies and hedge funds engaged in controlling and manipulating the production and trade of food as a commodity or as the basis of financial derivatives and futures.\n\n\nIt seems unlikely that we can design ourselves out of this dilemma but we might yet be able to learn our way through the collapse of the industrial paradigm of food systems towards a more sustainable future.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nAcknowledgement: This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020
