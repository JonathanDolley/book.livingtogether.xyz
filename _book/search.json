    "text": "Preface\nIn 1844, a group of weavers from Rochdale in England set up a small cooperative store on Toad Lane. Now referred to as the Rochdale Pioneers, their practical response to the misery inflicted on the poor by the industrial revolution became a touchstone for a rapidly growing movement of working class people empowering themselves through cooperation and grassroots democracy. What began as a multitude of local practical answers to the worsening crises of capitalist industrialisation in Britain, France, Germany and beyond soon became an international movement of economic democratisation that transformed the lives and communities of countless peoples around the world. Credit unions, farmer, worker and consumer cooperatives grew into huge federations wielding significant economic power and which included women as equal voting members decades before women won the right to vote in national or local elections. These cooperative organisations championed food safety and quality standards, fair prices, decent wages and working conditions and democratic management long before these ideas became part of mainstream conversation or legislation.\nThe modern cooperative movement that grew from these social innovations among the working classes in nineteenth century Britain and Europe is now a global movement encompassing around 12% of the world’s population. Represented by its own international organisation, the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA), the movement brings together a huge diversity of cooperative enterprises across almost all sectors of social and economic life. As legal forms of organisation, cooperatives, credit unions and other types of mutual associations have become remarkably successful at providing economic stability for their members in the face of the recurring crises of global capitalism. These successes, however, only partly reflect the original ambitions of the early cooperators, who dreamt of inspiring a complete transformation of society out of the chaos of contemporary capitalism and into a Utopian order of cooperation that would benefit the whole of humanity. Now that the UN and other international organisations have begun to reflect on the legacy and future of cooperativism from the perspective of environmental sustainability and social development, those earlier dreams of systemic change have taken on a new significance.\nThe present crises of climate and ecosystem breakdown, worsening pollution and socio-economic inequality and the rapid loss of trust in politics and institutions have prompted many to seek to recover the radical values of cooperativism and reinterpret them, often with a post-capitalist slant. To provide a coherent framing for these efforts, the idea of ‘New Cooperativism’ has come to be used to refer to cooperative projects which emphasise common good orientation, multistakeholder participation, a transformative stance against the status quo and a commitment to participatory democratic governance. These so-called ‘New Cooperatives’ are emerging all over the world as a new kind of social enterprise aimed at creating fairer and more sustainable ways of meeting people’s need for food, housing, energy, transportation, social and health care and to provide new contexts for community building and cultural renewal.\nAmong these essential sectors, food systems present perhaps the most complex and difficult contexts for change as they connect an intricate and global network of producers, processors, distributors, consumers, government ministries, research systems, multinational corporations, hospitality businesses, caterers and local retailers, among many other actors whose perceptions and practices are shaped by diverse and deep-rooted cultural traditions and sharply competing interests. The need for change is also extremely urgent. Contemporary industrialised food systems involve the extravagant use of non-renewable energy and toxic inputs manufactured from rapidly depleting fossil fuels to produce highly processed foods that cause multiple negative impacts on human health, all while polluting the environment, degrading ecosystems, driving pandemic risk from zoonotic spillover, and generating massive quantities of greenhouse gases. Neither do farmers themselves derive much livelihood security from this arrangement but rather face a constant downward pressure on incomes that is made worse by the growing impacts of an unpredictable and increasingly volatile climate and market. It is perhaps only from within the boardrooms of multinational food companies and agribusiness that the twentieth century approach to food and farming appears remotely defensible. The only remaining justification for the status quo is the share prices of profit-driven companies and hedge funds engaged in controlling and manipulating the production and trade of food as a commodity or as the basis of financial derivatives and futures.\nIt seems unlikely that change will occur from the top down, or if it does, it is even less likely that such change will be for the benefit of the majority of farmers and consumers. So the question is, as a growing grassroots movement for economic democracy and mutual aid, what contribution might ‘New Cooperatives’ make to transforming food systems from the bottom up?\nThis is a question I have been thinking and talking about for nearly 5 years. By taking a deep dive into the past and present of the Hansalim Life Movement in South Korea – one of the most successful and least known multistakeholder cooperatives in organic food and farming – I want to suggest some possible answers.\nThe first reason for choosing to study Hansalim is that it seems to me to embody the same values and aspirations of the ‘New Cooperatives’ as well as displaying some other features not normally associated with examples of New Cooperativism that have so far been studied. That makes it interesting as a case study from which to reflect on the ideas and initiatives that are associated with New Cooperativism in other contexts – which currently are drawn mostly from Europe, North and South America. The second reason is the size and scope of Hansalim as both a movement and a federation of diverse democratic organisations. The fact that such a large cooperative enterprise has been created in the organic food sector in an advanced industrialised country by small scale producers and consumers working together is remarkable. The final reason is the longevity of Hansalim. The Hansalim Life Movement will be 40 years old in 2025 and its roots go back even further to the 1960s. The ability for such a project not only to grow, but to resist the pressure of conforming to capitalist markets, degenerating, splitting or succumbing to demutualisation implies a certain degree of resilience and confirms that Hansalim is not just a niche experiment but a mature movement. From the perspective of New Cooperativism, Hansalim represents a rare and previously unrecognised example of a mature large-scale New Cooperative in organic food; one that brings together producers and consumers in a way that is normally thought impossible or at least highly impractical.\nWith this in mind, I applied for a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Global Fellowship in 2019 to lead a research project with the University of Sussex in partnership with Hansalim’s Mosim and Salim Research Institute in Korea.\nFor four years, since moving to South Korea in 2020, I have been involved in research about and with Hansalim. As a proof reader, I assisted the translation of the Hansalim Manifesto into English in 2021 at which point I also began my 3 year Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellowship to investigate the Hansalim Life Movement. As a researcher I am interested not only in the practicalities and organisational structure of Hansalim as a cooperative but also the history of the movement, the philosophy in which it is rooted and the experiences of the individual members of this unique community. This book introduces the story of Hansalim, explains what it is today and describes Hansalim’s fascinating journey from its roots in the pro-democracy movement in 1960s Korea to becoming a national Federation of Life Cooperatives. The material for this book is drawn from interviews conducted between 2022-2024 and Korean language materials collected over the same period, including academic papers, books and reports published by Hansalim, and archived materials held by the Mosim and Salim Research Institute.\nAlthough the writing process for this book began in the second year of my project, the amount of material and the complexity and richness of Hansalim as movement and federation of multiple organisations, each with their own histories, has meant that I still have a long way to go to complete it! I have chosen to publish the book in serial form online (i.e. one chapter at a time as each chapter is completed). My reason for doing this is that I want to make up for the current lack of English language information about Hansalim as fast as possible. I believe the story and experience of Hansalim will be of great interest to those in Europe seeking to transform food systems from the grassroots. So in this ‘first edition’ I present the introduction and chapter 1 along with two appendices of materials translated from original blog posts by Hansalim that will be of special interest to farmers. Together, this material is what I expect to be most useful for practitioners in Europe seeking a straightforward introduction to what Hansalim is. The later chapters will include some more detailed history and explanation of the philosophy behind Hansalim as well as personal stories of Hansalim members. Finally, I intend to write one or two chapters that draw out specific lessons for contexts beyond Korea.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship grant agreement No 892403 between September 2021 and August 2024.

    "text": "Imagine a food system which belongs entirely to the people growing, processing and consuming its products and which is designed not for profit but for permanence. Perhaps, instead of maximising profits for shareholders, its goal would be to build lasting relationships of trust and mutual care between rural and urban communities based on a shared responsibility for the future. Food would no longer be a commodity, the price of which is set by the ‘hidden hand’ of the market. It could perhaps become a symbol of mutual dependence, valued for the labour required to produce it while caring for the lifeworlds of the nonhumans whose continuing flourishing is the ultimate source of our own survival. Is such a system possible? If so, how would it be done and has it ever been tried at scale before?\nIf such an alternative had been successfully created in a modern industrialised society it would surely be known around the world and be the object of numerous studies and reports to understand how it could be expanded and replicated elsewhere. Unless, that is, it existed in such an unexpected place that no-one thought to look for it there, or when they saw it they didn’t know what they were really looking at.\nThese days most people associate South Korea with its wildly popular cultural products - BTS, Black Pink, K-drama and more recently K-food. And before K-pop, South Korea was best known for its miraculous economic transformation from rural backwater to industrial powerhouse. From a poverty stricken and divided nation in the 1950s, the country developed so rapidly that it has become an archetype of supercharged capitalist industrialisation. In just 4 decades it built a dynamic economy that boasts global brands such as Samsung, Kia and LG. However, these economic and cultural achievements are only part of the story of South Korean development.\nSince the early 1960s, as South Korea’s autocratic government was embarking on a program of rapid state-led industrialisation, a counter-movement of pro-democracy activists and organic farmers began to form credit unions and cooperatives to create networks of mutual support and solidarity among those who were suffering the worst effects of economic dislocation and oppression. By the 1980s there were thousands of these democratic economic communities all over the country and, when democratization finally began in 1987, they were poised to form the basis of Korea’s thriving civil society. The most visible of these were the huge consumer cooperative federations - Hansalim, Dure, HappyCOOP and iCOOP - which nurtured the growth of Korea’s organic food and farming sector and which continue to pursue important social innovations in multiple sectors of Korean economy and society. Although in English language literature they are commonly referred to as ‘consumer cooperatives’, they are somewhat different from the well known European and American cooperatives that many of us in the west have grown up with. They are so different, in fact, that I think the term ‘consumer cooperative’ is simply misleading and hides a much more complex reality. Let me show you what I mean.\nIn Seoul and many other cities all across South Korea there are shops with the name ‘Hansalim’ on their facades, 240 of them in total. They are run by democratic communities of local consumers and in these shops you can buy fresh fruit and vegetables, eggs, meat, rice and other grains. They also sell kimchi, oils and soy sauce and everything necessary for cooking in addition to a multitude of other preserved and processed foods from snacks to teas and herbal medicines. Alongside food items you can also purchase eco-friendly soaps and cosmetics and simple clothing and cooking utensils among a range of other household items. All of these products are made without artificial additives and through organic and eco-friendly methods by self-organised rural communities who adhere to an agreed set of standards on quality, safety and ecological protection. With a few exceptions, all are produced in Korea and sold at annually fixed prices agreed in advance by producers and consumers to ensure a fair and stable income for farmers.\nThe consumer and producer communities responsible set up the first store in 1986 and published a Manifesto in 1989 which described their goal as the transformation of society from a civilisation of killing to a civilisation of life in which we learn to live together with one another and with the non-human world in symbiotic relationships of mutual care. Nearly 40 years on, Hansalim has become a national multistakeholder federation of consumer and producer cooperatives which not only operates a comprehensive alternative food system but also funds a whole range of other activities to promote the Hansalim Life Movement as a grassroots democratic project for societal and cultural change through education, publishing, research, environmental campaigning, charitable aid and peer-to-peer financing.\nAnd so, in the most unexpected place - one of the most advanced and ruthlessly capitalist industrial economies in the world - hidden behind our preconceived notion of a modern ‘consumer cooperative’ is a successful 40 year old experiment in creating a self-sustaining, democratically managed, solidarity-based, comprehensive food system that upholds the goals of protecting and regenerating ecosystems while providing decent and stable livelihoods and healthy, nutritious food that is priced according not to its worth on the market but its true value. So perhaps Hansalim can also become for us in Europe and beyond, a prototype for what is possible and a seed of inspiration.\nWhere did Hansalim come from? What is it today and how does it work? And what might we in Europe learn from Hansalim’s experience as we try to transform our own food systems? These are the questions this book seeks to answer.",

    "text": "1.1 A movement, a manifesto, a business\nIn 1986 pro-democracy protesters were out in the streets fighting with police and trying to escape tear gas.1 Since seizing power in a military coup in 1961, General Park Chung-hee presided over 18 years of military rule. Following his assassination in 1979 and another coup, General Chun Doo-hwan installed himself as president, leading what was essentially a continuation of the military regime in the face of growing mass protests calling for democratic government.2\nIn the midst of such turmoil, a small group of farmers and activists opened a small rice store in the centre of Seoul. In light of the chaotic political situation, this was seen by their fellow pro-democracy activists as a betrayal. However, the creation of that first store, called Hansalim Nongsan, was actually a radical act of resistance and hope in the face of political uncertainty. The men and women who opened Hansalim Nongsan belonged to a small cooperative of producers and consumers in the city of Wonju, about an hour away from Seoul, and that store represented a first step in launching an ecological alternative movement that had been gathering support in Wonju and beyond since the late 1970s. Its founders where known as the Wonju Group.\nThe Wonju Group were a diverse collection of Catholic Farmers, urban housewives, pro-democracy activists, artists, poets and scholars who had been involved in the credit union movement in Wonju that was founded in the 1960s. They had witnessed the fundamentally destructive tendencies of capitalist and socialist industrialisation and they were looking for an alternative in the cooperative movement. However, they recognised that cooperatives were also vulnerable to the same fundamental mistake that lay at the heart of industrial civilization. That mistake was to assume a materialist, mechanistic view of the world which viewed humans and all life as replaceable parts in the machine of economic growth. It was this worldview, they argued, that gave rise to the characteristics of domination, alienation, separation and oppression in modern society.\nAs an alternative, they proposed a worldview founded on the sacredness and interconnectedness of all life. The first version of this worldview or eco-philosophy was outlined in the Wonju Report in 1982. As the movement began to grow the Wonju Group set up the first Life Cooperative in Wonju in 1985 and the Hansalim Nongsan rice store a year later.3 In this way, the Wonju Coop formally brought together organic farming and direct trade with the equal participation of consumers and producers.\nBy 1990 there were four Life Cooperatives with over 5,500 members and within just over another 10 years membership had grown to over 40,000. That is when things really began to take off and by 2008 there were 19 Life Cooperatives managing 84 stores for their 170,000 members. In 2023 Hansalim’s 27 Life Cooperatives and 15 Producer Federations handled annual sales of 485,066 million KRW (324.3 million euros) through 240 stores, an online store and a mobile app.4 From these sales, 330,610 million KRW (221 million euros) were returned to the 136 producer communities. That is nearly 70%! So what kind of business model has Hansalim created that provides those returns to producers while covering the shared business operations and funding a whole range of movement activities from the remaining 30%? And what lies at the heart of this unusual way of doing business?\n(Graph of growth)",

    "section": "1.2 Built on a relationship of mutual care",
    "text": "1.2 Built on a relationship of mutual care\nAt its simplest, the Hansalim Life Movement is a relationship of mutual care and responsibility between rural and urban communities. The core of Hansalim’s approach is expressed in this phrase: “Let the producer take responsibility for sustaining the consumer’s life and the consumer for sustaining the producer’s livelihood”.5 However, this mutual responsibility is about much more than simply direct sales as it also encompasses a shared commitment to protecting and restoring ecosystems and working for wider social and cultural change towards justice and peace.\nThis expansive goal is captured by the name itself: “Hansalim” (한살림). The first part of the word, ‘Han’ (한) contains two sets of paradoxical meanings. It expresses, firstly, a paradoxical double sense of being collectively one and individually one and, secondly, of spreading out as one and gathering in as one.6 In ancient Korean philosophy ‘Han’ refers to the divine Spirit or life of the universe which permeates all things living and inanimate and integrates the universe into an evolving cosmos.\nThe word ‘Salim’ (살림) has two related meanings. The first is ‘housekeeping’ which implies parental care, homemaking, food preparation, hospitality. It is perhaps the most practical of all human activities and is the bedrock of human survival and flourishing. The second meaning develops from this practical sense the philosophical concept of ‘nurturing’ which has the connotation of saving and restoring, bringing back to life, vivifying.7\nSo we see that the word ‘Hansalim’ expresses a relationship and an action. It encompasses the goal of nurturing or reviving all things, that is bringing all into a flourishing shared life together. In fact, the word ‘Hansalim’ is often used as a verb as when members encourage each other by saying “let’s Hansalim!”\nAmong Hansalim members, the word “Salim” is used to express their purpose in all their activities. So the collective mission of Hansalim is summed up in four phrases that each incorporate this word Salim.\nThe first, ‘Nurturing Food’ (밥상살림 — bapsang-salim) refers to the goal of providing consumers with safe, healthy, eco-friendly food and other household goods and this defines the responsibility that producers adopt for the life of consumers. The word in Korean directly translates as nurturing the dining table and the significance of this is that it refers to the act of sharing a meal, not simply consuming food. Second, ‘Nurturing Agriculture’ (농업살림 — nongup-salim) refers to the goal of securing stable and sustainable livelihoods for producers and this defines the responsibility which consumers adopt for the livelihoods of producers. Third, ‘Nurturing Life’ (생명살림 — saengmyeong-salim) expresses the responsibility of care for others (human and non-human) which producers and consumers together share and which is worked out through outward focused activities such as promoting eco-friendly farming, environmental campaigning, education, social welfare projects, and inward contemplative and reflective practices. Finally, ‘Nurturing Community’ (지역살림 — jiyeok-salim), emphasises the need to strengthen local community resources and relationships and to reach out to neighbours in need.\nSo how are these values put into practice? I’m going to tackle this question from bottom up, first from the rural or producer perspective and then from the urban or consumer perspective before describing the alternative economic system that brings them together.",

    "text": "1.3 In the form of a multistakeholder cooperative\nThe producer community is the smallest level of organization in Hansalim. In these communities farming is done together by a group of family farms who partner with one another to plan and coordinate their production, share knowledge and labour, and manage shared facilities and equipment. To join Hansalim as a producer, you would join one of these communities and receive training in eco-friendly farming and Hansalim’s production and processing standards.\nThere are 136 producer communities which cultivate a total of 11,300 acres. In addition to the producer communities there are 110 processing units which process raw materials from Hansalim’s producers as well as seafood and other products from local organic and environmentally friendly sources.8 The producer organizations are brought together into 15 regional federations with their own elected representatives which together form Hansalim’s National Producer Federation with their own elected president and employed staff. Many of these regional federations pool resources to run local distribution hubs with their own processing facilities and some have created complex systems to process and re-circulate farm wastes as inputs between multiple local farms.\n(map of producer communities)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Producer Community in Byeonsan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByeonsan Producer Community shared facilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Producer Community in Jeju, head office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Producer Community in Asan, distribution hub\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you join Hansalim as a consumer you become a member of your local Life Cooperative (one among 27 as of 2024). The word “Life” is significant because these cooperatives are not like the conventional consumer cooperatives that you would encounter in Europe or America. Their focus is not only responsible consumption but also seeking to live together in solidarity with one another and with producers and rural communities. Each Life Cooperative in Hansalim is a democratic autonomous organization formed by members to carry out collective activities, set-up and run Hansalim stores, organize charitable, cultural and educational activities and the joint activities between rural producers and urban consumers.\n(map of Life Coops)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeju Hansalim Life Coop office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeju Hansalim community kitchen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeju Hansalim community permaculture garden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusan Hansalim community kitchen\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, the producer communities and federations and the Life Coops form a federation of cooperatives, associations and businesses linked together through a shared business federation and the Hansalim Federation with its support organisations including a research institute, charitable foundation, solar power coop, publishing house, training institute and peer-to-peer finance platform.

    "section": "1.4 Creating an alternative economy",
    "text": "1.4 Creating an alternative economy\nIn simple terms, the Hansalim business model can be described as a contract-based direct sales arrangement in which prices and quantities are agreed annually in advance by producers and consumers with support from Hansalim’s employees. However, it is also very flexible in ways that are designed to support the needs of producers.\n\nA system designed for producers\nThere are four key features of Hansalim’s business model. Firstly: flexibility of production. Hansalim’s production system allows for a relatively wide range of production philosophies and techniques among member producers to ensure that producers have maximum autonomy. For example, one producer community might prefer a relatively simple style of organic farming with a small number of crops while another aspires to build a complex system of circulating agriculture with a large diversity of crops and livestock supported by recycling of farm wastes from one part of the system as inputs to others. Still others, especially fruit producers, might find it impossible to grow without a limited use of home made natural pesticides. A dogmatic insistence on a single farming philosophy would exclude many farmers who might be unable to follow a one-size-fits-all system in the face of local conditions or other resource constraints. Hansalim’s more flexible approach removes a significant barrier to entry for farmers who would otherwise need to spend a long time learning new techniques before starting to earn an income. This brings the added advantage that farmers who want to transition from conventional to organic farming can do so in a staged process while still making a living. However, it also creates a problem. How to maintain the trust of consumers when the diversity of production techniques is so wide?\nThis brings us to the second feature of Hansalim’s business model: simple and honest labeling. Transparency with consumer members is ensured through Hansalim’s own labelling system. For example, primary agricultural products are labelled under four main categories:\n\nOrganic (which would include conventional organic, permaculture and EM techniques);\nPesticide-free (when crop types and local conditions make it non-viable to exclude use of fertilizers);\nLow pesticide (for certain fruit crops which would be prohibitively difficult to grow without a limited use of pesticides);\nDomestic (for miscellaneous grains such as barley or black bean which are used as raw ingredients in some processed goods and feed for livestock).\n\nFor all four categories Hansalim’s standards are stricter than the national safety standards and products are tested regularly for residues, contaminants and radiation as appropriate to protect trust between consumers and producers.\nTo complement the flexibility and transparency of production methods the third feature - flexibility of supply - enhances the autonomy of producers and provides some added resilience to the system. Hansalim producers are not locked-in to exclusive supply contracts but have the freedom to supply whatever proportion of their crop to Hansalim they wish while simultaneously supplying through other channels such as government purchasing schemes for school meals. This applies to each producer community and also to each member of each community. So one farmer might supply 30% of their produce to Hansalim through their community while selling the rest through local government procurement for school meals. Or a producer community might sell Hansalim branded grapes through the Hansalim Federation while selling grape juice through another market under their own brand.\nFinally, for an additional level of flexibility, the contract-based system is supplemented by demand-based supply arrangements to allow greater flexibility for producers.\nTaken together, these four features of Hansalim’s business model mean that, within and between producer communities the level of specialization or circular integration and the combination of sales channels are all decided by the producers themselves. This makes for an astonishingly diverse range of production operations each tailored to the local soil and climate conditions and preferences of producers themselves, while ensuring a stable guaranteed income to as many farmers as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word ‘Hansalim’ written in life alongside a rice paddy on Our Seed Farm in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRice terraces on Our Seed Farm in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lowland rice paddy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanting out rice seedlings with a Hansalim producer community in Paju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVinyl house (polytunnel greenhouse) crops at Our Seed Farm in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrapes growing in a vinyl house at a Hansalim producer community in Okcheon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA vegetable field at Nunbisan, a Hansalim producer community in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA field of oats at Nunbisan grown for chicken feed and as an ingredient for making various types of Hansalim products that are processed on site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking home made organic fertilizer from Chicken faeces and crop waste on Nunbisan farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA green manure cover crop at Nunbisan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken sheds on Nunbisan farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside Nunbisan’s chicken sheds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing mushrooms on a Hansalim farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn orchard on a Hansalim farm on Jeju Island\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowland farming at the foot of a mountain in Byeonsan at the Sandle-pada Hansalim Producer Community\n\n\nThese images show just a tiny snapshot of some of the different farming landscapes, crops and approaches which form Hansalim’s complex agricultural systems. The system of labelling helps provide a sense of order to this complexity for the sake of Hansalim’s consumer members and also facilitates the progression of Hansalim producers further away from conventional farming methods towards progressively more eco-friendly alternatives. Let’s look at the overall share of production according to production type, crop type and supply type. The following graph, Figure 1.1, shows the flow of goods by tons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Flow of production quantities by type, crop and contract in 2023 (tons).\n\n\n\nOn the left you can see the four labelled production types of organic, pesticide-free, low-pesticide and domestic. In the centre, the crop types are divided into vegetables, staple grains, roots and tubers, fruit, and miscellaneous grains. On the right, crop types are categorized into supply type as either contract-based or demand-based supply. If you interact with the graph you can see the number of tons of each combination. The majority of production is organic and this accounts for most of the vegetable cultivation, almost all staple grains and root and tubers. These crop types are almost entirely supplied on a contract-basis. Pesticide-free production accounts for some vegetable supply, a fraction of staple grains and some fruit crops. It is in fruit cultivation that higher proportion of crops are cultivated according to ‘low-pesticide’ standards. This is because many fruit crops are especially vulnerable to pests and would not be viable for producers without some use of non-synthetic pesticides. Miscellaneous grains are mostly produced under the domestic label and supplied on a demand-basis.\nSo what happens to the revenue from these sales? As I mentioned above, until recently, with margins well below 30%, Hansalim was able to return 73% or more of the product price to the producers. Now, following several years of rising costs and worsening impacts of climate change the margin has come under increasing pressure and currently stands at just over 31% which leaves almost 69% for producers. This table in Figure 1.2 shows the breakdown of what the margin covers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivision\nRate\nSubdivision\nRate\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Federation\n0.81%\nSubscription fees\n0.55%\n\n\nService revenue\n0.26%\n\n\nHansalim Business Federation\n8.86%\nBusiness share rate\n8.61%\n\n\nProduction support fund\n0.165%\n\n\nPrice stabilization fund\n0.085%\n\n\nMember Life Coops\n21.7%\nRegional margin rate\n21.6%\n\n\nProduction stabilization fund\n0.1%\n\n\nGross margin rate (GPR)\n31.37%\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The breakdown of Hansalim’s margin in 2023.\n\n\n\nThat is virtually the reverse of conventional market distribution which usually takes a 50 - 70% margin. So what does this distribution of revenue look like from the point of view of the Life Coops, producers and the federal organisations? The following chart, Figure 1.3, shows the flow of value (in euros) from the sales of goods (on the left) through each Life Coop (center) to the share of revenue provided to each category of organization (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Flow of value from sales revenue through each Life Coop to other organizations (euros).\n\n\n\nYou will notice that the vast majority of sales are of ‘federation goods’ which are those supplied through the business federation’s distribution channels. A much smaller percentage of sales are accounted for by so-called ‘local goods’ which are supplied independently from Hansalim’s central distribution system. The central column of the chart looks a bit messy, but the point is that the majority of sales are through shops managed by the Life Coops in Seoul and Gyeonggi (the province surrounding Seoul) which together form the largest and densest population centre in Korea. On the right hand side you can see that the share of revenue returned to producers is by far the largest, while the margin covers the budgets of the Life Coops and finally the Business Federation and the Hansalim Federation.\nThis distribution revenue is achieved through a combination of:\n\nRecovered costs from distribution by removing the multiple opportunities from profit gauging by intermediaries;\nPrices set to reflect the true costs of production; and\nEconomies of scope and scale achieved through shared business activities and collectively owned capital at local, regional and national levels.\n\nAfter providing for producers’ livelihoods, what then does the remaining 30% pay for?\n\n\nA different kind of consumer experience\nThe largest portion (21.7%) goes to the Life Coops themselves to cover the costs of running stores, handling local distribution and their various educational, participation and engagement activities. Life Coops are autonomous member owned businesses which run the Hansalim stores in their local areas. They decide when and where to open new stores, how to manage them and how to organize local distribution options such as home delivery. Stores are usually run by an employed manager and the Life Coop’s Store Activists (consumer members who are trained and paid to staff the stores) and products are ordered through the Hansalim Business Federation and delivered from their national logistics centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Seoul Hansalim, Yangju Store (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Seoul Hansalim, Ssangmoon Store with home delivery vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside a Hansalim Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wide-angle view inside a Hansalim Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Store and Food Culture Center at Jeju head office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the store at the Jeju Hansalim head office\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Hansalim store you can buy virtually everything you need from food to household goods and even cosmetics. Almost all these products are made by Hansalim producers and processors with a few exceptions for some household items and a handful of fair trade products. Hansalim branded sales through the business federation are supplemented by local goods sourced by each store according to the decision of each Life Coop. What this means is that there is usually just one type of everything you need rather than multiple brands of the same product so the shop size is relatively small compared to a regular supermarket. Here are a few examples of the products that are available in my local Hansalim store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Rice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweet potatoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFruit and vegetables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTofu and other ingredients for cooking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDairy products and other chilled processed goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast cereals and flour etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrozen meats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottled juice, preserves and other ingredients in jars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabbages for making Kimchi (these are distributed over a period of a week or two each November in time for ‘Kimjang’ when families and communities gather to make Kimchi together)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady meals! Frozen foods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favourites, traditionally made rice wine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even buy cosmetics made by Hansalim with eco-friendly natural ingredients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold cleaning products are also available including toilet paper and kitchen paper made in Hansalim’s Anseong logistics centre from recycled milk and drinks cartons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a small number of Fair Trade goods from select partners in other countries such as Olive Oil and chocolate\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim stores also differ from a conventional supermarket in another way. They often provide the venue for member activities and encounters between consumers and producers facilitated by the Life Coop’s Organizing Activists (members who are trained and paid to organize opportunities for consumers and producers to meet each other and share food and other activities together). From the beginning of Hansalim, relationship building among consumers and between consumers and producers has been a top priority.\n\n\n\nAn activity room inside a Hansalim Store showing the small kitchen, library and meeting space\n\n\nThere are various ways consumers can build community together and participate in the livelihoods of producers. Neighbourhood meetings and small groups provide a context for consumer members to learn and build relationships through reading groups, cooking classes, social activities, and environmental activism etc. ‘Helping hands’ visits are organized by Activists to bring members to help producers with farming activities such as planting, weeding and harvest and to join in with traditional rural rituals and share meals together. Community work is also an important shared activity in which members and producers raise money for charitable causes, donate food to people in need and provide education and support to marginalized groups. Consumers often visit the producer communities for local festivals or just to see the farm, share a meal and get to know each other. Producers also visit stores to introduce their new products and many develop special relationships with particular Life Coops as well as participating in Hansalim conferences and multistakeholder committees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visit to Nunbisan farm by Life Coop members\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing a meal during the visit to Nunbisan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Coop members visiting the rice fields at Our Seed Farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining in with planting out rice seedlings on Hansalim farm in Paju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA traditional ceremony showing respect to the land\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing food together as part of the ceremony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing stories after the ceremony and rice planting activity in Paju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA ‘helping hands’ activity at a Hansalim farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim producers and consumer members participating in a conference organised by the Hansalim Food Life Education Centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA gathering of North Seoul Hansalim Organisational Activists to share ideas and prepare for the year ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA ‘yard sale’ to raise money for charity organised by Hansalim Activists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA national research forum organised by Wonju Hansalim Life Coop\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of these activities are supported by funds allocated in the budgets of the Life Coops and the Hansalim Federation which ultimately come from their combined sales. The chart below, Figure 1.4, gives you an idea of the amount of interaction between consumers and producers in the course of a single year. It shows the number of ‘person-visits’ categorized by each Life Coop and by the type of activity in 2023. Exchange refers to activities involving interaction between producers and consumers and engagement refers to activities among consumers themselves. You can see that there were around 59,000 encounters between individuals in 2023 that were directly facilitated by Hansalim’s member Life Coops. Although many of these are repeat visits of individuals (so the total number of people involved will be somewhat less) you still get a sense of the sheer scale of relationship building that is going on within Hansalim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Participation in 2023: engagement among consumers and exchanges between consumers and producers.\n\n\n\nIn addition to selling to members and organizing member activities, Life Coops also engage with the wider community by running a whole range of educational activities and training, community kitchens, environmental campaigns and community building activities and some have also set up new cooperatives in solar power and in the care sector. On top of all these activities, the high point of Hansalim’s cultural life are the festivals which are held at national and local levels. For example, the Autumn festivals bring producers and consumers together for food, drinking and traditional games and dancing. They provide a special context for making friends and creating a sense of shared identity and camaraderie.\n\n\n\nCelebration Festival at Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDancing at the festival in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutumn harvest festival in Goesan (in the foreground is the rope used for the mass tug-of-war game!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim flag flying among the dancers at the Autumn festival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rope being prepared for the giant tug-of-war game\n\n\n\n\n\nFor consumers and producers then, there is a lot of fun to be had as a member of a Hansalim community. This is a vitally important part of the rhythm of hard work broken up by fantastic celebrations and informal contexts for relaxation together. None of this would be possible, however, without the hard and often hidden work of the Practitioners.\n\n\nThe special role of practitioners\nIn Hansalim, employees are referred to as ‘practitioners.’ They are the people who make it possible to put the producer-consumer relationship into practice by running the businesses, coordinating movement activities and organizing the many processes that are required to keep each member organization running and working together as a federation. They are not only professionals in logistics, marketing, strategy etc. but they also act as mediators between consumer and producer members and their organizations. Whereas a manager in a corporate enterprise might be able to focus solely on negotiating financial dealings with clients and suppliers, Hansalim practitioners often find themselves also negotiating the complex conflicts in values and expectations between Hansalim members, making their role especially difficult and important.\nThe largest employer of practitioners within Hansalim is the Business Federation which takes the next largest share of revenue after the Life Coops (8.86%) to cover the costs of labour, logistics, promotion and marketing, product development etc. One of the most important assets managed by the business federation is the Anseong Logistics Centre.\n\n\n\nHansalim’s Anseong logistics and processing centre\n\n\nFinally, the smallest share of the margin (0.81%) is used to fund the Hansalim Federation which organizes the national-level governance and policy-making processes, supports Hansalim’s educational, cultural, publishing, research and coordinates collaboration and solidarity activities with others in Korea and especially small-scale farmers abroad, and provides support to the member Life Coops.\nIn 2023 there were a total of 291 practitioners working in the member Life Coops, a further 235 working for the Business Federation and 40 at the Hansalim Federation. These were supplemented by 1,396 Activists working in the stores and to organize member activities (see Figure 1.5 below. Together with the 3,579 producers and processors they generate enough revenue to support themselves and the broader collective efforts of the Hansalim Life Movement to bring about social and cultural change towards a more sustainable way of living.\nA report by Hansalim in 2020 estimated that, across the whole of Hansalim:\n\n“There are 489 practitioners, 1,544 activists, 238 executives, 337 others, and a total of 2,370 members nationwide who organise this vast membership into businesses and movements. Add to this the 2,192 primary producers and 1,241 processors, and you have 6,041 people (as of December 2019) supporting their families.”9\n\nWith such a large and complex organisation, you might think that there must be some strong central authority controlling everything from the top down and making sure efficiency is maximised and operations meticulously coordinated. Happily (or perhaps sadly, depending on your point of view) that is not the case in Hansalim.",

    "section": "1.5 Governed through deliberative democracy",
    "text": "1.5 Governed through deliberative democracy\nOne of the most extraordinary features of Hansalim is the depth of their commitment to deliberative democracy and local autonomy. This emphasis on democracy has deep roots, but before we explore those in more detail it is worth having an overview of how Hansalim fits together today as a federation of democratic organisations. The governance structure of Hansalim is based on the principles of subsidiarity, mutual responsibility and deliberation rather than top down command and control.\n\nSubsidiarity\nBelow, Figure 1.5, is a diagram of Hansalim’s various organizations as they existed in 2023 and how they related to each other, laid out in order of how authority is delegated from top to bottom. At the top are the individual members. The 890,000 Member households and the 3,579 Producers. They are the owners of Hansalim. Below you can see the Life Coops, Producer Organizations and the Support Organizations and in the box labelled ‘Member Organisations Autonomous Activities’ I have listed the numbers of people involved (as far as data is available). The word ‘Practitioner’ here is Hansalim’s term for employed staff member (as mentioned above). Remember that ‘Activists’ refers to consumer members paid to either organise producer-consumer activities or work in the stores. Between them, the member organisations elect a total of 212 delegates to the General Assembly of the Hansalim Federation (maximum two 1-year terms). The General Assembly elects a board of 36 directors including the chair of directors who holds the title of president (maximum two 2-year terms). The board appoints the executive directors of the Federation, the Business Federation and the support organizations but cannot interfere with the governance and management of the member Life Coops or producer organizations. The standing committees, conferences and steering committees are where deliberations take place over policy and strategy decisions and they operate at local and national level involving producers, members and practitioners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Hansalim’s many organisations and their relationships.\n\n\n\nSo you see that neither the Hansalim Federation nor the Business Federation are ‘apex’ organisations or ‘head offices’ but rather, they are supporting organisations whose purpose is to facilitate the successful business of the Life Coops and producer organisations while running the delegated shared movement activities and supporting the independent movement activities of member organisations.\n\n\nMutual responsibilities\nThe way the Hansalim Federation sees itself in relation to the other Hansalim organisations can be understood with the help of the following diagram, Figure 1.6, which was published in the Hansalim 2017 White Paper.10 I have reproduced it here with some minor modifications and translated it into English. With the Hansalim Federation at the centre each of the stakeholders are listed along with their mutual responsibilities in relation to the Federation. Hansalim’s stakeholders include five categories: Producers, Members (i.e. consumer members), Practitioners, Activists and the Local Community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: A map of Hansalim stakeholders and their responsibilities.\n\n\n\nAlong with Producers, the Members share the main responsibility for governance of the federation and their local associations and Life Coops. Members elect delegates to the General Assembly, participate in committees, respond to and carry out member surveys and also govern the business and movement activities of their own Life Coops. Members are also expected to consume responsibly and encouraged to participate in activities to support producers and help the local community. From the Federation they receive goods produced according to Hansalim standards and values as well as support (organisational and financial) for member engagement activities and member education.\nProducers also elect delegates to the General Assembly, participate in the production consultation system and respond to and carry out producer surveys. Their responsibility to the federation is to produce goods according to Hansalim standards and values and in return the federation is tasked with ensuring that their livelihoods are sustainable.\nThe Practitioners’ main responsibility is for running the business activities of the member organisations and the shared business organisations (i.e. the Business Federation) but they also play a role in supporting the governance and movement activities. Although Practitioners are not directly represented in the General Assembly, the executive directors (a Practitioner role) sit on the board of directors at each level of organisation from member to federation respectively. The Workplace life council is the closest thing to a labour union in its role of representing the interests of Practitioners. The Federation’s responsibility to Practitioners is to support their training and performance and increase job satisfaction. However, the role of Practitioners has evolved over time and is becoming increasingly ambiguous. Originally, during Hansalim’s early days, their main role was to act as a bridge between producers and consumers while running the business activities. In the beginning people joined Hansalim as Practitioners to support their shared vision and often worked very long hours for low pay doing whatever was needed. Now, as Hansalim has grown larger, many of those who worked for Hansalim from the early days have taken on managerial positions while the hiring of new employees has become more formalized and specialized. As a consequence, the role of Practitioners as a bridge between consumers and producers has become weaker and the emphasis has shifted towards running business operations.\nActivists were originally member volunteers whose role was to organize consumer activities and also act as a bridge with producers. After a while, it was decided that they should be financially compensated for their work and their roles should be more clearly specified. Now, Activists are members who have received training for specific roles and are paid a wage to work in the stores, receive phone orders and organize various activities for producers and members.\nThe Local Community is included as a stakeholder category as producers, members and activists seek to identify and take action on local needs. They work with local community organizations and representatives of such organizations are also invited to participate on various councils as appropriate. In fact, it is quite common for Hansalim members and producers to simultaneously hold official positions in Hansalim and other local grassroots organizations and social enterprises.\nThe organizational role of the Hansalim Federation in this structure is to support each of these different stakeholders to realize their own and Hansalim’s values in their various activities. A large part of this involves organising committees and meetings, collecting opinions from members and supporting the deliberative process among member organisations through training, research and timely communication of information about each area of business and activism.\n\n\nDeliberation\nThe deliberative processes in Hansalim encompasses the grassroots groups and conferences and work their way through the various levels of organisation to the committees, boards of directors and general assemblies at local and national level. Formal meetings are required to follow the regulations in the articles of association and bylaws and are usually run according to an adapted set of rules from Robert’s Rules of Order by Henry Martyn Robert (1837-1923)11 and scrupulously minuted and reported. Opinions are also gathered through online forums, member surveys and organisation messaging boards. Finally, the auditing process provides an opportunity for independent monitoring and constructive criticism from people elected to the Supervisory Council.\nAt the heart of the deliberative process is the delegate system In each Life Coop where the number of members is large enough to make direct participation impractical, delegates are elected with the responsibility of reflecting the opinions of the wider membership through their participation in the General Assembly. Their core role is to ‘ensure that the wishes of members are properly and responsibly represented’.12 Thus, in addition to attending the General Assembly to vote on decisions and elect directors, they are expected to be the channel of communication between the board of directors and members. To fulfil this role they need to join in with member activities and gatherings, listen to the opinions of other members, build relationships of trust and participate in the regular briefing sessions in preparation for the General Assembly. The term of office for delegates is set by the articles of association of each Life Coop within a range of four years. As members of the General Assembly they have the authority to amend the articles of association, elect and remove officers (i.e. members of the board of directors and executive directors), approve financial reports and budget plans, approve the supervisory council reports and decide on refunds of invested contributions to members who withdraw or are expelled.\nThis is quite a heavy responsibility for an unpaid position and the success of the deliberative process depends upon the voluntary commitment of members willing to take up responsibility for democratic management of the cooperative. It also looks like a very inefficient system of management which requires excessive amounts of time and resources for the sake of a very slow decision making process. As early as 1984, the Wonju Group were very familiar with the difficulties of democratic management. So much so that their training material for consumer cooperative leaders states: “Democracy is a good thing, but it’s a pain in the arse!”13\nSo how can we explain the persistence of Hansalim members with such a cumbersome system of governance? And does it bring any benefits that justify the continuing investment of time and energy? For an answer to the first question you will have to wait for chapter 2 which describes the historical roots of Hansalim in the pro-democracy struggle. For now, I want to offer an answer to the second question. What is the point of such an apparently inefficient system of management?",

    "section": "1.6 On a tilting unfinished journey",
    "text": "1.6 On a tilting unfinished journey\nThe answer is that the only way to hold together a movement of continuous collective action without resorting to coercion is through bringing conflict into the open where it can be transformed and resolved. Consider how difficult it is for a family to get along without arguments and disagreements. Even petty differences can cause lingering feuds. In a family as in a commerical company, such conflicts are typically resolved by whoever has the authority to pass judgement, dole out punishments and rewards or even expel the ‘trouble maker’. Now imagine a group of people who were not born or hired into a hierarchy of power relationships but got together voluntarily, expecting to be treated as equals. Unfortunately, the absence of a pre-existing power hierarchy does not automatically remove the thorn of conflict but simply submerges it within the informal network of personal relationships, where, hidden in the rich soil of privacy it germinates. Far from generating spontaneous harmony, this anarchic anti-hierarchical form of organisation multiplies conflicts exponentially.\nThe only way to counteract the undermining effects of the formation of cliques and factions around conflicting opinions and interests is to acknowledge the inevitability of their existence and provide a context for healthy confrontation. The purpose of democracy in Hansalim is to create that context. The point of doing so is that when conflicts are explored and resolved in public, the uncomfortable process of resolution itself generates a kind power that is totally inaccessible to a ‘strong leader’ who rules by right or might. It is the power to act in concert, to work together in a kind of messy unity that does not crush diversity but turns it into a source of creativity.\nThe term used by the poet Kim Ji-ha to describe the evolutionary nature of a living movement such as Hansalim is “tilted balance” or a kind of dynamic (dis)equilibrium:\n\n“The philosophy of ‘tilted balance’, along with paradoxes, is crucial to understanding life. However, the term ‘tilted balance’ does not adequately describe the world of life. That is, the adjective ‘tilted’ and the noun ‘balance’, which denote states, do not capture the dynamism of the ever-changing world of life. The world of life is constantly tilting and tumbling rather than being in a stable balance.”14\n\nYoon, in his 2024 report about Hansalim’s evolving structure writes:\n\n“When choosing policies and institutions in Hansalim, we can present the ‘tilted balance’ in the”Hansalim Manifesto” as a decision-making principle that balances reality and ideals, associations and businesses.”15\n\nHansalim’s journey from a small movement of producers and consumers to a national federation has been far from smooth and simple. As successful as it has been, it was and still is fraught with struggles, controversies, failures and frustrations. One common phrase I heard from my interviewees in Hansalim is that “Hansalim looks beautiful from far away, but when you get closer you can see it is a lot more ugly.”\nThat ugliness is the reality of trying to work and live together with people whose backgrounds, perspectives and desires are so often radically different and even competing. It is the challenge of finding compromises that reflect a shared core of values while also trading off some of those values against others for the sake of a unity which is always and inevitably unsatisfactory. That is why, in addition to “moderation” - the virtue required to find the “middle way” - “discernment” is also key to maintaining this continually oscillating ‘tilted balance.’ Again, Kim Ji-ha explains this idea as a key aspect of the Confucian concept of the doctrine of the mean (中庸):\n\n“A more precise expression of this spirit is the term shijung (discernment - 时中), which appears in”The Doctrine of the Mean”, the second of the Four Books, written by Confucius’s grandson Zisi (子思). It means to strike a balance in an ever-changing situation. This kind of person is called a virtuous person. A person who is principled, but is also able to make judgements and adjust their behaviour according to the time and situation.”16\n\nIt is this principle, rather than any specific organisational model, that appears to define Hansalim’s journey and their continuing commitment to deliberative democracy. It provides the means for collective discernment as a process of mutual understanding through talking and listening.",

    "section": "1.7 Conclusion",
    "text": "1.7 Conclusion\nFor those in Europe and other regions of the world outside Korea, Hansalim can appear to be a uniquely Korean phenomenon. “Surely, it is only the collectivist culture of Korea that makes such a community possible. It could never succeed in our hyper-individualist western societies.” But you must not forget that the two strongest influences on contemporary Korean culture are Confucianism and American consumerism. The former provided the rationale for a strictly hierarchical and patriarchal culture that dominated Korean society for several hundred years before the latter collided head on with it during the post-war period, giving rise to a uniquely oppressive mixture of competitive consumerism and rigid conformism.\nIt was in this context that Hansalim emerged as a concrete expression of the desire felt among many at the time for a different kind of society built upon equality, mutual respect and care for other humans and the nonhuman world. I have a feeling that this same desire has not gone away, but only deepened, not only among Koreans but equally among contemporary people in Europe and beyond.\nHowever, no matter how much you desire to create something like Hansalim, managing such a large organization (or rather, federation of organisations) without a dictatorial head office but in a deliberative and democratic way is very, very hard work. If you were in it for the money, you would not do it like this. But for every member of Hansalim I have spoken to so far, its not about money, but about being part of a community dedicated to caring for each other and to creating a peaceful and thriving future for the world. So as a reader from outside Korea who aspires to transform food systems, you need to keep in mind that Hansalim’s success is mingled with failures and disappointments and comes at the cost of a great deal of personal sacrifice, collective conflict and agonising, trial and error and lots and lots and lots of ….. meetings. Just look again at Figure 1.5 and notice the number of committee members in the column for Life Coops!\nHaving said all that, even if you are prepared for such a challenge, I do not think it is possible to simply transplant Hansalim’s model to other countries. It has its own history and unique context from which it emerged and it is not a static model but an evolving community in a continual process of change.\nBut what is perhaps much more useful than a blueprint, is Hansalim’s story and the myriad stories of the people who practice Hansalim (as a verb). These stories carry the values of Hansalim, the spirit and emotion of Hansalim people and the experience of countless challenges and success that they faced along the way. These stories, more than anything else, carry the seeds that could produce new fruit in other contexts, as long as there are those with the determination to cultivate them.\nTo hear some of these stories, I am afraid you will have to wait a little longer for the rest of the book to be written and published. I’ll do my best to finish it as soon as possible! Each new chapter will be published here as soon as it is written.\nAnd of course, it is a story without an ending. Which means, in all likelihood, there are those among you reading this book who will end up playing a role in it one way or another.\n\n\n\n\nHansalim. “Because of You We Live: Hansalim 30th Anniversary White Paper.” Seoul, Korea: Hansalim; Hansalim, 2017.\n\n\n———. “Hansalim Annual Report 2021.” Seoul, Korea: Hansalim; Hansalim, 2021.\n\n\n———. “Hansalim Federation 14th General Assembly Resource Book.” Seoul, Korea: Hansalim Cooperative Federation; Hansalim, 2024.\n\n\n———.

    "text": "2.1 A Cultural-Historical Background\nFor the Hansalim founders, democracy was not simply a suitable management structure but a fundamental way of life that had been tested and proved through decades of struggle against successive dictatorships. The role of cooperatives in the struggle for democracy in Korea went back to the pro-democracy movement of the 1960s and 70s (in which many of the Hansalim founders were involved1) and inherited a long tradition of anti-state resistance from the pre-war independence movement (see Figure 2.1). But even before the western models of cooperatives and credit unions were transmitted to Korea there existed a long and sophisticated tradition of cooperative institutions in rural Korea.\nIn this chapter we take a long detour through history to understand the deep foundations of the Korean practice of democratic self-government as a peasant tradition that inspired the resistance against colonial rule and domestic dictatorship and found its clearest expression in the Hansalim Life Movement. This part of the story introduces not only a fascinating world of rural peasant culture but also a long evolution in the roles and rights of women, the end of slavery, religious transformation and even some philosophy. Brace yourselves.\nIf you look closely at the timeline in Figure 2.1 you will notice that, before the annexation of Korea by Japan, it was known as ‘Joseon.’ The entire peninsula of Korea from the boarder with Manchuria in the north to the Island of Jeju in the South Sea was governed by the Yi Dynasty for more than 500 years from 1392 until a brief period of independent modernisation began in 1897 only to be cut short when Japan began its take-over in 1904.2 The Yi Dynasty and its literary elites were heavily influenced by Confucian ideology and statecraft and the Joseon era was shaped by the dominance of a uniquely Korean form of neo-Confucianism.\nThe influence of Confucianism in Korea is a legacy of centuries of intellectual and cultural commerce with China as Korea’s nearest neighbour by land. However, in the context of the history of Korean civilization (between 3000 and 5000 years depending on who you ask) the influence of Confucianism plays on one part among many and the patriarchal structures and social hierarchies it gave rise to were in fact created by a concerted effort at socio-cultural transformation.\nFor 500 years consecutive monarchs, aided by a ruling gentry of Confucian Scholarly Officials, the yangban, used gradual changes in policy, law and customs to transform the peninsula into a caste-based and rigidly patriarchal society structured around the Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty (to superiors) and propriety - knowing ones place and following the rules. Although already in place in simplified form for centuries earlier, by the late Joseon period the hereditary class system had become highly complex (see Table 2.1), restrictive and increasingly unstable. Joseon society was categorised into the citizen classes (yangin) and the lowborn classes (cheonmin). The former were subject to taxation (with the exception of the yangban) and were given different levels of rights, obligations and legal protections according to their respective status. The latter, though they were exempt from paying tax, were more or less excluded from normal society except when their work was useful to a member of the citizen classes.\nOutside the royal family, the most privileged classes were the yangban (or ‘two orders’) of officials: the civilian scholar-officials and the military officials. They were the hereditary landed aristocrats of Korean society and took up roles as high-level government officials. They lived in substantial houses with estates along with their extended families, servants and slaves. Their relative status within the yangban class was determined by a combination of family lineage, patronage, scholarly tradition (or faction) and the national civil service exam.\nNext in status to the yangban were the secondary status classes. Most of these were either the mid-level officials which included the (jungin) – who had expertise in languages, medicine, law, astronomy, accounting, drafting, calligraphy and painting – and the government clerks responsible for administration (hyangni). These classes were also hereditary and lived in the centre of towns and cities.3\nNext came the descendants of the concubines of yangban and mid-level officials. They were the illegitimate sons of aristocrats and officials who were excluded from the rights and privileges enjoyed by legitimate heirs. Instead they inherited their mother’s lower status and, although they had relatively more access to wealth and education than their commoner peers, they were systematically discriminated against in law and custom.\nAlmost at the bottom of the hierarchy of citizens came the commoners (sangmin or yangmin). They were the peasant farmers (property-owning and tenant), craftsmen and merchants. Together they formed the majority of the population and bore the heaviest tax burden in addition to being subject to corvee labour and military conscription. Finally, at the very bottom, were the commoners who worked in lowborn positions, mainly low-ranking service jobs for the state that were deemed to be undignified or unclean. Although they legally shared the same status as regular commoners they were treated more like the lowborn.\nNow we come to the ‘lowborn’. The cheonmin were those without legal status as citizens, whose work was seen as demeaning or corrupting but whose services were necessary for the commoners or desired by the royal family, the yangban and the other official classes. The most respectable of the lowborn were the propertyless professionals who included shamans, healers, gisaeng (female entertainers or courtesans) and servants. Below them were the baekjeong or ‘ignorant men’ who were the butchers, wicker weavers, itinerant performers, executioners and tanners or leather workers. Not only were the baekjeong discriminated against in law and through other customs to do with speech and clothing but they also had to live in separate communities, segregated from the rest of society. Finally, there were the unfree (nobi) – the concubines, public slaves (state-owned) and private slaves – who were chattel property. Even their status as slave was hereditary and thus their children automatically became the property of their yangban masters. Thus, discrimination against lower status groups by those of higher status ran throughout the whole hierarchy of Joseon society, ensuring the political and financial stability of the government and the ruling classes.\nYou might notice that one particular group of people is missing from this list in Table 2.1. With the exception of courtesans and concubines, there is no mention mothers, daughters and wives (legitimate ones) of the men of each class. That is because the status of women in Joseon requires its own discussion in the context of this wider class structure. And this story is much more complex and interesting than contemporary stereotypes of Korean society might lead you to believe. It begins, of course, with religion.\nPrior to the Joseon Dynasty, during the Goryeo period the state religion was Buddhism and before that, Shamanism. The Silla kingdom (57 BC - 935 AD) and the early Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392) were matrilineal4 with most women retaining inheritance rights on an equal basis with men and independent of marriage (except among aristocratic families).5 Although women remained under the jurisdiction of men and their roles and behaviour were strictly defined, they nevertheless enjoyed some degree of agency and economic independence and protection of their property rights. It was also customary for newly married men to live with, and work for, their wife’s family for their first years of marriage in contrast to the convention introduced in Joseon times for the wife to leave her family to live with her husbands family where she often became not much more than the servant of her mother-in-law.\nNot only were many women in a better position in the domestic sphere in the Goryeo period, they also enjoyed more opportunities outside the home to participate in public life. In contrast to Confucianism, Buddhist doctrine allowed women to gain education by joining temples and also provided for a respectable way for women opt out of conventional family life by choosing a single life and living alone or becoming a nun. Buddhism also allowed for women to remarry without sanction and even have multiple husbands.6\nThe transition from the Goryeo period (918-1392) to the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910) brought with it a turn away from Buddhism as the state religion towards neo-Confucianism. Reacting to the internal conflicts and upheaval of the late Goryeo period, the newly established Joseon state sought to create a more stable Kingdom. On the one hand, with a purposeful focus on Confucian ethics, the state enacted tax reforms to stabilise government finances while eliminating unfair tax burdens and refocusing the economy on agriculture and away from commerce and other economic activities7 regarded as improper (because they were profit-making). On the other hand, new measures were used to protect class privilege by adopting the neo-Confucian model of family and social structure as state ideology; perpetuating chattel slavery, reinforcing dependence of the majority of commoners on feudal systems and closing down social mobility.\nIt was not only class structure that was hardened, but the role and status of women also suffered a massive decline throughout the Joseon period. One key part of the state’s project of social reform was the radical transformation of cultural and legal structures to create a patriarchal society which enforced a strict division in gender roles in addition to class status with the family hierarchy as the central social structure. They legislated a shift to a patrilineal structure and strict primogeniture in which inheritance passed exclusively to the husband and then the eldest son.8 In addition to the economic subordination of women, the state propagated the neo-Confucian ideology of namhak yeomaeng (learned men, ignorant women) and promoted the ideal of the “wise mother, good wife” whose virtue was expressed through samjong chido (“three obediences”) – obedience to her father before marriage, her husband after marriage and her son after the death of her husband. Essentially women became the property of men; subject to complete control by their fathers and husbands, permitted only to aspire to becoming a wife and a mother.9 While severely eroding the rights and opportunities of women, the Joseon reforms also provoked a creative and evolving “culture of dissent” among Korean women of all classes who began to find ways to subvert patriarchal norms and retain certain forms of influence despite the limitations imposed on them.10\nAlthough strictly limited, there were ways for individual women to gain influence and exercise some choice over their future outside of marriage, for example by becoming a shaman, gisaeng (entertainer) or healer. In addition, the rules and conventions of Confucian behaviour became progressively more relaxed the lower the social class. Thus, while the wives of Yangban (gentry) and royalty where hardly permitted to leave the inner rooms of their homes, slave women and commoners wives were able to leave the house to run errands, work in the fields or go to market. But this greater flexibility came at a heavy price since the livelihoods of commoners and slaves were often bitterly hard and dependent in large part on the favour of the yangban. Female slaves could not marry without their masters permission and would often be forced into marriage with other slaves by their masters to produce more slaves. They might be taken as concubines or used informally for sexual services by their masters and members of the household. Gisaeng were especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation by men who considered them as “flowers on the roadside for anyone to pick.”11",

    "text": "2.3 Cooperative organisation among the commoners\nIf you were to wander the countryside and towns in those days you would have seen a stark contrast in living conditions between the rulers and the ruled. As a mostly agrarian society of peasant farmers, the common folk lived in mud huts with thatched roofs and made careful use of every natural resource available to maintain their meagre lives. Here and there, however, you would catch an occasional glimpse of the most beautiful traditional Korean houses or : all expertly built around landscaped courtyards and settled on massive stone foundations from which rose wide wooden pillars to support ornately tiled roofs. Positioned in the most auspicious and picturesque locations, equipped with underfloor heating and designed to provide natural air conditioning, these architectural masterpieces provided a walled and gated paradise for the landowning male elites who occupied all the highest offices of the bureaucracy and military. In these mansions - many of which remain today - the gentry and their households of wives, concubines, children and house slaves lived together in a family-scale replica of the authoritarian Confucian state, ruling their lands and districts in similar fashion.\nIn fact, generations of sexual exploitation of women as concubines by the ruling elites had produced a large and growing cohort of educated and capable scholars and clerks who, despite their skill, were blocked from social advancement because their mothers’ status excluded them from the inherited privilege of their paternal line. This led to a growing undercurrent of social unrest among not only the oppressed slave and lower classes but also among the second-class castes who faced systemic discrimination on the basis of patrilineal status.\nOver the previous decades, the experiences and grievances of these non-aristocratic classes had been expressed and widely shared through a vibrant and often subversive and satirical popular culture in literature, (singing of epic narratives), (mask dances) and folk painting. One of the unexpected catalysts for this flowering of folk and non-aristocratic culture was the invention, several centuries earlier in 1446, of the Korean alphabet. King Sejong and his state research institute, the Hall of Worthies, had created the unique writing system to enable the common people to become better educated (mainly about Confucian ideals) without having to endure the difficult process of learning the Chinese characters used by the aristocracy and literati. Consequently, the gradual spread of the ability of ordinary people to put the vernacular into writing finally gave rise, in the 19th century, to a popular genre of literature by and for the common people - with many women among its most popular authors. It also facilitated the standardisation and spread of the narratives. Examples of such literature include biographies of the lower classes as well as tales of righteous bandits robbing the rich to give to the poor (sound familiar?!). Spread by the rise of this popular culture, the experiences and living conditions of normal people across the country were becoming more widely known, no doubt contributing to a growing sense of shared identity among the common people and middle-level elites who openly derided the corruption and hypocrisy of the aristocracy and Buddhist monks.\nJust as this popular culture was on rise, a young man called Choi Je-u was about to experience a dramatic spiritual awakening. He was born in 1824 near Gyeongju (south-east Korea) to an impoverished that had fallen from favour and lost his social status. This fact, and the additional stigma of being the son of a concubine left him with little opportunity to earn a living except to teach local children, having himself at least received an education before the death of his father when he was 16.\nAfter an arranged marriage he taught for several years and continued to study Confucianism, Buddhism and Daosim. Then, between the age of 24 and 34 he wandered the country observing the pitiful living conditions of the common people and the endemic corruption of the Confucian bureaucracy. He also became more aware of the influx into Korea of new ideas through Catholic missionaries and western Imperialists as well as the growing threat of military domination by the western powers. Perceiving his country to be in a state of chaos and confusion in the face of the military and technological superiority of the west and it’s apparently unifying ideology of Catholicism or “Western Learning”, he sought an alternative faith that could provide a rival unifying and empowering force to the Korean people.\nOn returning to his family after his travels, he spent forty-nine days in meditation and prayer in a cave near the Buddhist temple of Dongdosa. Finally, in 1860, he experienced an encounter with God in a mysterious voice that said: “Do not fear and do not be afraid. Humanity calls me Sangje (God): don’t you recognize Sangje?”\nChoi Je-u reported that God told him to teach the Truth and gave him a healing talisman in the form of the ‘Great Ultimate’ and an incantation which is a prayer to be filled with the Spirit of God that brings divine life within, guards against forgetfulness and awakens an awareness of all things.\nFollowing this encounter, Choi Je-u began life as a wandering teacher, spreading the Truth that he called “Eastern Learning” (Donghak) to distinguish it from the Western Learning of Catholicism. He also wrote his teachings in Chinese script and the Korean alphabet to make it accessible to both the scholarly classes and the common people. These writings become the Donghak scriptures and include descriptions of his experiences, philosophical thoughts and discussions with his followers as well as poetry, prayers and stories.\nWriting what became the Donghak scripture the Suun writes that the Divine Spirit (or Hanullim) told him “My mind is your mind” (曰吾心即汝心也) which is interpreted to express the true nature of humanity as bearers of Divine Life. Suun is given an incantation by Hanullim which is the means for receiving the Divine Spirit (靈) and practicing the Way.\nThe incantation encompasses the central teaching of Donghak that the Hanullim (or God) is in all things and therefore humans also bear God within them. However, through selfishness and negative outside influences, people have forgotten this truth that they are fundamentally one with God and habitually act in opposition to the Way. This is the cause of human suffering and evil. To recover oneness with God one needs to cultivate the mind of God within oneself and to act justly towards others (Susim Jeonggi 守心正氣).12 As people cultivate this ‘Heavenly Way’ then a new world begins to dawn, a ‘kingdom of heaven on earth’ which will ultimately come to encompass the whole cosmos, not through violent revolution but by natural becoming.\nFor Suun, the Heavenly Way can be found only through a particular way of knowing which he calls buryeon giyeon (不然其然) which can be translated as “not so (buryeon), yet so (giyeon)”. Kim and Yoon13 explain this concept as follows:\n\n“According to Suun, we usually live in the phenomenal world of ordinary experience, which is giyeon. However, ultimately and in the deepest level of our being we live in the world of buryeon, which lies beyond the realm of the ordinary sense experience.”14\n\nOne legitimate area of relative autonomy for women was in the home, given the expectation that, in their role as housewife and mother, they control the household economy and oversee the moral education of their children. The latter provided an indirect route to involvement in affairs outside the home through their strong influence over their children, especially first born sons. The former, made it possible for women to accumulate some degree of economic power. Finally, via the long established institution of gye women were able to gather their economic resources together for their own purposes independent from men.\nGye were mutual aid societies with roots in ancient Korea and which flourished in Joseon Dynasty, especially as trade and the monetary economic became more important in the later Joseon period.15 Originally the preserve of Yangban (government officials), following the eitheenth century, it was commoners and peasants\nThis\nThe colonial government perpetuated these\nIn Korea’s highly patriarchal society, structured by the most conservative form of Confucianism which restricted women to the role of housewives , Korean women in the 1920s were economically dependent on men, had little access to education and had very few opportunities outside of marriage, motherhood and housework. Despite these obstacles, many housewives and single women saved what little money and resource they had to set up their own consumer associations to support their economic needs and gain some level of independence.\nThe concept of housewife was used in Colonial period by colonial government and nationalist to restrict women’s roles to household and protect male power. Korean women took this concept and subverted it, transforming it into something different… (see book).\nIt is another step in a long history of Korean women of all classes finding ways to resist and subvert patriarchal Confucian norms and restrictions and to gain greater economic independence and social power.",

    "text": "2.5 Fighting for independence\nThe annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 was the culmination of a long history of invasions and exploitation of the peninsula. It solidified Japan’s control over Korea and began a long period of oppression during which many of the freedoms of Korean citizens were restricted and the colonial government embarked on a project to destroy Korean cultural, linguistic, and national identity and to completely assimilate Korea through a wholesale re-education of the population through economic domination and their own colonial school system.16 As part of this project, the colonial government also developed a national infrastructure of state-run agricultural and financial cooperatives to manage rural and industrial development and facilitate top-down control and decision making.17 The Korean resistance against the colonial government sought to apply alternative models of cooperativism inspired by grassroots movements from Europe and Japan as well as Korean traditional models of autonomous mutual self-help that had been already present in Korea since the precolonial era. These included reciprocal resource sharing associations called Gye18, cooperative labour associations called Dure19, mechanisms for voluntarily assisting those in need in the local community called Pumasi20 and the tradition of Kimjang, the communal making and sharing of Kimchi.\nThus, under Japanese colonial rule, cooperatives in Korea evolved along two parallel pathways – statist and grassroots – and while statist cooperatives appeared to contradict the very principles of cooperativism – being extensions of the state bureaucracy and neither independent nor democratic – grassroots cooperatives developed in connection with Korean nationalist and socialist movements dedicated to Korean independence.21\nAfter the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, most cooperatives were forcibly converted into rural promotion movements or dissolved due to the mobilisation for war and their leaders were arrested.22 Following Korea’s liberation from Japan in 1945 the cooperative movement was further disrupted by the Korean war and the division of the peninsula.",

    "text": "2.6 Fighting for democracy\nFrom the 1950s onwards, following the Korean war, grassroots cooperatives that had emerged as part of the anti-colonial independence movement in the 1920s and 30s began to re-form. At the same time the state adopted the colonial era apparatus of cooperatives created by the Japanese to control the rural and industrial economy. Park Chung-hee united the agricultural and financial cooperatives created by the colonial government to form the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF or Nonghyup) which now boasts of being one of the worlds’ largest agricultural cooperatives. Although it is called a cooperative, it functioned as a para-state organisation and was used as a bureaucratic tool of state control to drive through the green revolution in agriculture and to manipulate political support for the Park regime among the rural population.23\nIn contrast, closely connected to the emerging anti-Park democratisation movement, grassroots cooperatives started to spread again and to promote cooperative ideas throughout the country, establishing schools, consumer cooperatives, credit unions, and medical cooperatives to respond to the desperate need for affordable medical treatment for survivors of the war.24 The organic farming movement also began to spread through the influence of the Poolmoo school (now known as Poolmoowon) which established the first consumer cooperative in 1959 in South Chungcheong Province and, starting in 1975, developed the largest organic farming region in Korea. Through the 1970s and early 1980s, the pro-democracy Catholic Farmers Movement, Catholic Priests’ Association for Justice (CPAJ) and other Christian groups, credit unions and consumer cooperatives along with democratic movements among factory workers, peasant farmers, and students continued to increase in influence and spread throughout the country.\nAmong the leaders of this movement was the Catholic Bishop Ji Hak-soon, who became the first bishop of Wonju in 1965. He had left North Korea before the war to train as priest in Rome and, while there, he was deeply impacted by the spirit of the Vatican Two Council which urged the church to become more outward focused on the needs of local communities and to support ecumenical unity; to become a church run by and for the people, and for the poor and marginalised in particular.25\nIt was in Wonju, that Ji Hak-soon met Jang Il-soon who was to become one of his closest friends. Jang Il-soon was a native of Wonju and dropped out of Seoul National University (SNU) after the war to found Daeseong School in Wonju to provide a free education to local children. After a failed attempt to run for political office, he spent three years in prison between 1961 and 63, originally facing a death sentence, accused of being a communist. After his sentence was commuted and he was released the state put him under surveillance and prohibited him from public lecturing or writing. With no other options, he became a farmer and an artist, painting calligraphy which he gave away to everyone and anyone. Within the context of the church, Ji Hak-soon gave him the opportunity to teach again and, in 1967, he began training lay Catholic members to prepare for a transformation of the church into a self-reliant lay-centred organisation that supported a wider rural development movement of credit unions and cooperatives.26\nWith a population of just 100,000, Wonju diocese was an impoverished region of coal-mining and farming communities. The church was dependent upon foreign aid for its survival and the town itself was a cultural backwater with very few resources. As soon as Ji Hak-soon took office he and Jang Il-soon set up Wonju’s first credit union in 1966 and founded Jinkwang Middle School in 1967. Jang Il-soon began to organise training courses for cooperative and credit union members and established the Cooperative Education Institute in Jinkwang school to develop the cooperative movement beyond the Catholic Church.27 The school’s students and teachers also created the first school cooperative in Korea, Jinkwang Cooperative, to purchase books and equipment and run the canteen.\nOne of the teachers at the school was Park Jae-il. In 1969, after his after his release from prison for his involvement in the June 3rd Movement (protests against the military regime’s policy toward Japan) he moved to Wonju to join the Social Development Committee and the Catholic Farmers’ Association, led by Bishop Ji Hak-soon. He became a teacher at Jinkwang School and attended one of Jang Il-soon’s lectures after school one day. He was so captivated by the vision for reviving cooperation among the common people that he quit teaching to join the cooperative movement full time, taking up a key role in the Cooperative Education Institute. From that moment he became a lifelong student of Jang Il-soon and worked alongside him and Bishop Ji Hak-soon in the cooperative and rural development movement in Wonju. He would later become the president of the Catholic Farmers Association and then Hansalim’s first chair of directors.\nIn addition to promoting education Ji Hak-soon also built cultural spaces, hospitals and welfare facilities for the disabled. Among these projects, the most significant was the cultural centre which he built in front of Wonju Cathedral. Sponsored by religious organisations from Europe and the United States and dedicated on July 12th 1968, the Wonju Catholic Center was the first civic cultural centre of the Korean Catholic Church. The three story building – run by the diocese and staffed by young lay church members – included offices, meeting rooms, an exhibition hall, projection room, first-floor cafeteria, basement room and dormitories. It quickly became a popular meeting place for young people and a hive of creative activity, hosting performances by local musicians and exhibitions by local artists. The main hall was used to stage plays by Wonju’s Sanya Theatre Company directed by Jang Il-soon’s younger brother Jang Sang-soon and the basement room was the venue for DJs to play pop and classical music from a record collection which apparently exceeded even that of the local radio station!\nAround the Bishop, Jang Il-soon, Park Jae-il and their friends, an informal network of pro-democracy and cooperative movement activists began to gather. The Wonju Group, as they were known, began to expand the cooperative movement beyond Wonju into Gangwon province and to forge links across religious and ideological divides. Both Jang Il-soon and Ji Hak-soon made a point of reaching out beyond the boundaries of the Catholic church to other religious groups, not only to other Christian dominations but also to Buddhists. Priests, pastors and monks would visit each others congregations to preach and meet regularly at restaurants to share meals and talk together. The Catholic Church in Wonju became a church not only for believers but for all people striving to build a better and more democratic society. Following the example of Jesus, they sought to serve those in need without distinction and to freely support all who worked for the good of the whole community.28\nJang Il-soon saw the cooperative movement as a training ground for democracy for the whole community and a means of empowering people to become responsible citizens.29 He described it as a “movement for service to the masses, abandoning arrogance and radical elite consciousness.” and a “downward crawling movement.”30 In his lectures, Jang Il-soon reminded people of their own traditional culture of rural cooperation in Korea through Dure (farmers coops), Gye (village credit unions) and Pumasi (informal labour exchange). He referenced the 19th century history of cooperation among the British working class (the Rochdale Pioneers) and the credit union movements in France and Germany as examples of people finding ways to break free from corporate exploitation and live together on their own terms through mutual aid and self-reliance.31 He drew inspiration not only from Jesus’s teachings but also from Buddhist scriptures, Daoist and Confucian philosophy, Korean traditional spirituality and Ghandi’s example of non-violent resistance to enlarge people’s awareness of themselves and the world.\nAs a symbol of this broad and inclusive vision, the Wonju Catholic Centre became a hub for students and other pro-democracy activists and writers who gathered from Wonju and beyond to talk and drink late into the evenings in the cosy basement room. One of those young people was a poet named Kim Young-il who wrote under the pen name “Ji-ha” (芝河). Originally from Mokpo, Kim Ji-ha had moved as a child to Wonju with his parents. At Seoul National University he became active within the pro-democracy movement in Seoul and, when he returned to Wonju, he brought with him a cast of activists and artists who quickly joined forces with the growing cultural movement (minjung movement) in Wonju. Together they created yard plays (a form of traditional peasant theatre called madang-geuk, 마당극), mask-dances and plays for theatre. These plays raised the profile of Wonju among the wider national minjung movement and before long, Wonju was being called “the holy land of democratisation.”32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJi Hak-soon (1921-1993) - Bishop of Wonju, founder of Wonju Credit Union and Cooperative Movements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJang Il-soon (1928-1994) - teacher, farmer, artist, Hansalim founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPark Jae-il (1938-2010) - farmer, activist, Hansalim founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Ji-ha (1941-2022) - Poet, activist, Hansalim founder\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, with the Wonju Group, Jang Il-soon and Ji Hak-soon reorganised the church in the Wonju diocese into a network of self-governing self-supporting parishes and set up a program of education and training aimed at empowering the poor and marginalised to form self-sufficient self-governing communities across Gangwon province. Their vision was for a cooperative movement that was economically and politically independent from the authoritarian state and which promoted rural and urban development led by communities themselves.\nHowever, just as things were starting to take off catastrophe hit. In 1972 the large-scale flooding of the Namhan River basin caused widespread devastation in Gangwon and surrounding provinces. In Wonju Diocese the floods damaged 50,000 buildings and displaced more than 140,000 people.33 Bishop Ji Hak-soon went to Germany to ask for funds from the catholic charities Miserere and Caritas to support rebuilding. With the money they provided (2.91 million marks or around $360,000) he set up a Disaster Countermeasures Project Committee to coordinate a long-term recovery project. However, instead of simply providing unconditional aid, as was normally done under such circumstances, the committee targeted their resources at supporting communities to become self-sufficient. Food and money were given as wages for productive work rebuilding communities, restoring farmland and developing new income sources for farmers such as setting up village craft workshops.\nYoung people from the Wonju Diocesan Youth Association who had been involved with the cooperative movement in Wonju were recruited to act as counsellors. This title of ‘counsellor’ was chosen intentionally to avoid the impression that they were responsible for leading or directing the disaster response. Instead, their role was to visit the affected villages, learn about their needs and provide advice and training to enable villagers to take leadership of the reconstruction and development process themselves. The requirements for receiving support for projects were that they were productive so as to provide a steady income, communal rather than individual and managed cooperatively by the villagers. The ultimate goal was to rebuild solidarity within and between village communities who had suffered years of exploitation under colonial and now military rule that had led to widespread mistrust among the rural population.\nThis was a particularly special time for Jang Il-soon. He began to see what he had been dreaming of for so many years take shape in reality in his own community. Hundreds of villages across three provinces participated, creating credit unions and cooperatives, restoring the culture of shared agricultural labour and managing their affairs democratically through village assemblies. Others saw what was happening too and the pattern of rural development through cooperation that began in Wonju spread across the country.34 But it was not to last long.",

    "text": "2.7 Fighting for a civilisation of Life\nAlthough the Wonju movement made a significant and lasting contribution to rural development and democratisation35, it was carried out in resistance against the increasingly authoritarian Yusin regime under Park Chung-hee. Top-down state-led projects of agricultural industrialisation, rural improvement and political indoctrination through Nonghyup and the Saemaul Movement (New Village Movement) contributed to the ongoing suppression of the Wonju group’s activities. In a bid to achieve self-sufficiency in rice, the state adopted a new high yielding rice variety, Tongil rice, which was rapidly extended to farmers through a combination of incentives and coercion36. It required heavy fertiliser and pesticide application to achieve its promised yields37 which were supplied exclusively through Nonghyup. These pesticides were highly toxic and little training was provided to farmers about how to minimise risk of exposure. Despite the undeniable improvement in rural incomes stimulated by the state-led green revolution, as the use of chemical pesticides rapidly increased through the 1970s many farmers became sick from pesticide poisoning, ecosystems became increasingly polluted and food safety concerns grew among consumers. Jang Il-soon and others in the Wonju Group began to recognise the dangers of too narrow a focus on productivity and profit sharing. Somehow, cooperation needed to be extended beyond humans to include the natural world in a symbiotic relationship.\nThen, in 1974, in what seemed like retaliation against the Wonju Group, Bishop Ji Hak-soon and Kim Ji-ha were arrested, along with 253 others. Ji Hak-soon was court martialled under new emergency measures brought in by Park in reaction to growing unrest and pro-democracy protests among university students nationwide. His sentence was 15 years in prison on the charge of funding an anti-state group and masterminding a plot to overthrow the government.38 Kim Ji-ha was sentenced to death, commuted to life and released after 10 months only to be arrested again and his death sentences renewed. He spent 7 years in prison until he received a stay of execution.\nUnder pressure from the newly mobilised Catholic resistance and widespread anti-government protests, Park released Ji Hak-soon in 1975. But the government’s suppression of democratic movements intensified with new emergency measures and sweeping powers to control anyone who opposed him. During this difficult time, unable to engage directly in pro-democracy activism or the cooperative movement Jang Il-soon painted calligraphy, drew illustrations and wrote poetry, holding exhibitions to raise funds in support of others and communicate his resistance through art. In the years up to 1979 unrest and mass protests continued to spread until the shocking assassination of General Park by his own head of Central Intelligence, Kim Jae-gyu.\nThe democracy movement, that had been suppressed by Park, sprang back to life, as people rekindled hope for a transition to genuine democracy. But the new government fell in a matter of weeks as the chief of defence General Chun Doo-hwan led a military insurrection on December 12th 1979 and soon declared martial law.\nThe immediate reaction by citizens has become known as the “Seoul Spring”. Waves of mass protests spread across the country as students and workers took to the streets to oppose the military’s takeover and call for democracy. The military’s brutal response involved mass arrests, beatings, torture and killing of protesters. Things quickly came to a head in the city of Gwangju in south Jeolla province, a hotbed of pro-democracy activism.\nWhile mass protests in the city had been held peacefully with police cooperation during the previous days, in preparation for General Chun’s final takeover of the government, paratroops and tanks had been sent to Gwangju to suppress the protests, beginning by arresting most of the leaders of Gwangju’s democracy movement. On May 18th, when students attempted to enter the city’s Chonnam National University campus they were brutally beaten by the waiting paratroopers and turned away from the university gates. This provoked spontaneous protests among students which spread across the city throughout the day, calling for an end to martial law and the removal of Chun Doo-hwan. This time, they were met by violence from the riot police and confrontations escalated throughout the day as students fought back and the numbers of protesters steadily grew. When the paratroopers began to chase down and to strip and beat the demonstrators and bystanders alike, the student protest became a popular revolt.\nThe next day it wasn’t just hundreds of students on the streets but around four thousand citizens - high school students, shop owners, labourers, housewives, priests and teachers - came out to support the students and confront the police and paratroopers in front of Province Hall. When the police fired tear gas and the paratroopers charged the demonstrators, they responded by breaking up paving stones to throw and collected metal pipes and other implements to use as makeshift weapons. Molotov cocktails, drums of oil and nearby vehicles were used to attack and drive back the troops. Taxi drivers took on the role of ambulances to take the injured protesters to hospitals. Buses, trucks and phone booths became barricades.\nThe clashes between citizens and military became more violent and the paratroopers used their batons, rifle buts and bayonets to attack the crowds and hunted people down as they fled down alleys and into nearby buildings. Whoever they captured they stripped, beat and tortured, leaving many dead or with life changing injuries and taking many more students back to their camp as prisoners. Even some of the riot police who tried to help the wounded, unaccustomed to the extreme violence perpetrated by the military forces, were themselves attacked by the paratroopers.\nOver the next few days more than 200,000 demonstrators fought against the police and paratroopers across the city. Convoys of over 100 taxis and some buses and trucks joined the demonstrators on the streets and some began to use vehicles as battering rams and fire bombs to attack the paratroopers blockades. The streets were covered in burning cars, debris and the bodies of dead and injured protesters lying in pools of blood. Citizen Militia began to capture vehicles, explosives, rifles and ammunition to strengthen their stand against government forces who had begun to use live ammunition on the crowds leading to several fatalities and provoking growing rage among the citizens. Then the paratroopers deployed machine guns, automatic rifles and snipers to attack the citizens and military helicopters also opened fire on the crowds. Despite their resort to lethal force, the paratroopers were overwhelmed by the scale of the uprising, and withdrew to the outskirts of the city where they prepared for a large-scale offensive with reinforcements from the army’s 20th Division.\nThe demonstrators took control of Province Hall and other parts of the city center and organised a Citizen Settlement Committee to negotiate with the government forces. Having withdrawn from the city centre, soldiers blockaded Gwangju and were ordered to use lethal force against any resistance. Finally, after five days of blockade, in the middle of the night on the 27th May 1980 three special forces teams and a division of more than 3,000 soldiers moved on the city centre to recapture Province Hall and Gwangju Park in a battle that ended with 27 citizens and 2 soldiers dead and 295 citizens detained.\nOver the course of the uprising, 20,000 trained soldiers were deployed to the city of 800,000. The total number of casualties is not known, as the government acted quickly to cover up the incident and manipulate the data reported. Conservative estimates are that over 200 of Gwangju’s residents were killed by government forces and many more hundreds injured while the so-called ‘ring leaders’ were imprisoned and tortured. Despite the immediate government cover up, news of the massacre at Gwangju spread among democracy activists and students and helped to undermine the legitimacy of the Chun regime, becoming a rallying cry for the pro-democracy movement.\nThe events in Gwangju were followed by rumours that the government was preparing to target other cities like Wonju which were also centres of pro-democracy activism. Deeply shocked and grieved by the news of Gwangju, and fearing for the people of his own city, Jang Il-soon went into hiding and urged everyone to keep quiet. His lack of action angered many in the democratisation movement and marked the beginning of a shift in his attitude towards forms of political resistance.\nA few months after the Gwangju uprising and subsequent massacre, Kim Ji-ha was released from prison in December 1980. A lot had happened since his initial arrest and he had also had time to reflect himself on the experience of the Wonju Group. When he was reunited with Jang Il-soon they discovered they had both come to the same change of direction in their thinking.\nJang Il-soon described it in this way:\n\n“The Hansalim movement was something I had been thinking about for decades, and another was the consumer cooperative movement in the 70s (260), and as I continued the anti-dictatorship movement, I realized that I had to break out of the old Marxist paradigm, because it was not going to solve the problem, and it was going to continue the vicious circle. When I saw that they were spraying pesticides and fertilizers and trying to industrialize the city, I thought that the entire riverbed would be devastated. I told Mr. Park Jae-il, who was trying to start a rural movement in Wonju after the June 3 incident,”We should go in the direction of saving the farmland and food for the community.””39\n\nSince the mid-1970s, Jang Il-soon had been developing his philosophy and way of life around the teachings of Haewol (Choi Si-hyung), a virtually forgotten leader of an indigenous Korean religion called Donghak (sometimes written Tonghak and now known as Cheondogyo or the Heavenly Way). It was the ethical and cosmic vision of Donghak, and especially the practical spirituality of Haewol which became the foundation of the Hansalim movement as it emerged in Wonju through the 1980s.\nDonghak was founded in 1860 by Su-un (Choi Je-u)40 at a time when Korean society was in turmoil under pressure from foreign interference, rapid economic change, a corrupt bureaucracy and a monarchy in the process of collapse.41 Su-un taught that all things bear Hanullim (divine life) within themselves and that ‘sagehood’ or unity with Hanullim was open to all regardless of education, class, gender or age simply through sincerely seeking and stilling ones own heart to listen. His message of equality, simple spirituality and reverence for the sacredness of all things, spread like wildfire among the peasantry and disillusioned middle classes alike. Fearing a revolution, the authorities quickly arrested him and executed him in 1864.\nSu-un’s successor, Haewol expressed the Donghak teaching that ‘people are heaven’ in three practical rules: honour heaven (敬天), honour people (敬人), and honour all things (敬物). These three phrases express the idea of serving people as heaven and valuing the life of all natural things equally. Jang Il-soon revived Haewol’s teachings and sought, through Hansalim and the Life Movement, to implement them in the form a new kind of cooperative movement that unified humanity with one another and the cosmos in a symbiotic and spiritual relationship. He is quoted as saying:\n\n“Hae-wol, the second teacher of Donghak, said that if you know a bowl of rice, you know everything in the world, and Byeong-hee, Ui-am Son, also said that a bowl of rice is”born of a hundred people” (百夫所生), that is, it is made by the sweat of many peasants. He said that, but isn’t it true that it’s not just people who make it by sweating, but the heavens, the earth, and the whole world become an ensemble and move together as one, so that bowl of rice becomes a cosmic encounter? “If you go a step further, there is a saying in Haewol’s words,”Ichunsikcheon,” (以天食天) which means that heaven eats heaven. In Donghak, it is called innaecheon (people are heaven, 人乃天), and not only people are heaven, but every grain is heaven, every stone is heaven, every worm is heaven.”42\n\nThis new direction was sharply at odds with the rest of the democratisation movement at the time which was becoming more explicitly revolutionary and militant in response to Chun Doo-hwan’s intensification of violent suppression. By 1985, it was clear that the memory of the Gwangju uprising and the Chun government’s massacre of civilians was firmly fixed in the national psyche and each year following, the anniversary of the uprising was marked by increasing numbers of participants who commemorated the victim’s sacrifice for democracy. Students began to resort to to self-immolation and public suicide as new forms of protest. Jang Il-soon was horrified by this self-destructive violence in protest against the regime and called instead for non-violent, passive resistance instead of violent struggle.\nThe new emphasis on the natural world as sacred and a spirituality that looked suspiciously more like shamanism or Buddhism than Catholicism must have been hard to accept for many of the devout Catholic members of the movement. It might seem odd then, that a movement led by Catholics and grounded in the Catholic church should come to embrace an apparently non-Christian philosophy. But on closer inspection, Donghak actually seems quite well placed to fit alongside Catholic social teaching by re-emphasising the sacredness of the nonhuman world. Jang Il-soon’s reinterpretation of Donghak ideas within his own life as a Catholic and his ability to bring them into synergy with Jesus’ teaching through his lectures must have gone a long way open the hearts of others. Finally, through a difficult year-long process of intensive discussion the Wonju Group came to an agreement on transitioning the cooperative movement in Wonju into a Life Movement rooted in Donghak philosophy.\nThe new direction was expressed in the Wonju Report in 1982 which was written on behalf of the group by Kim Ji-ha. The report criticised capitalist and socialist industrial models of civilisation as equally destructive and incapable of producing a fair and sustainable society and called for an alternative movement for the transformation of society centred on the concept of Life. Publication of the Wonju Report was followed by the organisation of training courses and lectures and a study tour in 1984 to cooperatives in Japan. In 1985 the Wonju Consumer Cooperative was created, with Park Jae-il as chairperson, to organise store-free direct trade with organic farming communities. The store in Seoul, Hansalim Nongsan, followed in 1986 and in 1987 the Hansalim Community Consumers’ Cooperative and the Hansalim Producers’ Association were founded. This led to the formation in 1988 of the Hansalim Community Consumers Alliance in Seoul with 70 members and the Hansalim Producers’ Council in Wonju with 70 farmers.\nAs the movement was gaining traction, the Wonju Group formed the Preparatory Group for the Hansalim Study Gathering which held five meetings to discuss and diagnose the problems in Korean society and consider how the Hansalim Movement should respond. These were followed by eleven study sessions and four discussion meetings to review contemporary social movements around the world, study various economic, philosophical and social theories, and survey Korea’s own cultural history of cooperation in search of the future direction for Hansalim. This process culminated in the publication of the Hansalim Manifesto in 1989 which set out the philosophical foundation of the movement and outlined the direction of its practical implementation.\nOne of the striking things about the Manifesto, aside from its fascinating philosophical and spiritual discussions, is its lack of prescriptions on methods and models of organisation. In fact, the cooperative model itself is never mentioned and appears only in the background as the most appropriate means available at the time for organising economic cooperation as part of the wider Life Movement. This lack of definition of organisational strategy set the scene for a continual evolution of forms and structures within Hansalim as circumstances changed, new approaches were tried out and succeeded or failed, and as learning and experience accumulated. As a consequence the subsequent development of Hansalim as a movement and organisation is extremely complex and diverse but the core principles of democratic autonomy and ecological responsibility run all the way through it as the hard-won fruits of decades of committed struggle and sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\nBurmeister, Larry L. “Agricultural Cooperative Development and Change: A Window on South Korea’s Agrarian Transformation.” In Transformations in Twentieth Century Korea, edited by Yun-Shik Chang and Steven Hugh Lee, 78–100.

Production communities are the basic organisations responsible for the production and delivery of Hansalim products. The community plans how much of each crop will be grown in a given year.\nMostly village-based, farming communities live close to each other and meet monthly to produce and manage the crops they promised to their members. They exchange information on eco-friendly farming, welcome new members, and work together to promote the Hansalim movement in the community. To become a Hansalim producer, you must join a production community and receive education and guidance on the values and production standards of Hansalim through the community.\nEco-friendly farming is harder to do alone. Hansalim producers who practice life-saving farming are currently farming together in more than 130 farming communities across the country.\nHansalim farming is special even though it is eco-friendly. This is a series on the differences between Hansalim’s farming methods according to the Hansalim Production and Delivery Standard.",

This is known as a ‘separation distance’. The separation distance can be provided by a watercourse or road between the two fields. In the absence of these, a barrier of at least 1 metre in height must be erected, or if the terrain does not allow for a barrier to be erected, the barrier must be set back into the farmland and produce produced beyond it will not be supplied.\nIn addition to this, they plant taller crops alongside their fields, communicate frequently with neighbouring conventional farmers, and sometimes take responsibility for weeding the perimeter. Producers go to great lengths to keep pesticides out of their hard-earned green fields.",

In particular, rice is inspected every year at the time of purchase.\nThe same pesticide has different residue allowance standards depending on the crop, from 20ppm to 0.01ppm, and since January 2019, the government has decided to apply a standard of 0.01ppm to crops that had no standard. This is the concentration of a swimming pool full of water and a tablespoon and a half of diluted ink. ==Hansalim’s allowable pesticide residue standard is 1/20th of that of eco-certification, which is twenty times stricter than the government’s.== We also strive to add trust in the production process through frequent management of the production community and on-site inspections by the working organisation and members, rather than judging safety based on post-inspection numbers alone.",

At Hansalim, we use commercially available organic materials, but we often make our own because it’s not just a substitute for chemical fertilisers, it’s the foundation of sustainable farming.\nCompost is made from manure from domestic animals, rice husks from farming, pulp from crushing sesame seeds, and bark or sawdust from nearby trees. It’s often added to fields before planting, or spread as a fertiliser when crops are growing.\nSome producers who need to grow seedlings make their own topsoil. The government’s eco-certification only requires that pesticides be tested in the final product, so it’s okay to use topsoil sprayed with chemical fertilisers to promote germination or pesticides to prevent viruses, but Hansalim starts with pesticide-free topsoil in which the tiny seeds grow.",

Most farmers buy their seedlings from nurseries, but Hansalim producers grow their own seedlings, the beginning of the farming process. This is the principle of self-nurturing that Hansalim aims for.\nSprouting seeds is like awakening latent life, and we don’t know how many will sprout, or if they will grow into healthy seedlings, so we leave one greenhouse per household dedicated to nursery stock, sowing much more generously than we need.\nSprouted seedlings are much more sensitive to changing temperatures, moisture, and pests, so they need to be checked several times a day for temperature, watering, and bug control. It’s less work and less money to buy seedlings, but even with eco-friendly seedlings, you can’t be sure how they’ve been raised. Homegrown seedlings that have been tended to and grown under their own power for two to three months will produce stronger, healthier crops than those that have been sprouted with the help of chemicals to stimulate germination and prevent viruses.",

Hansalim producers do not use herbicides, growth regulators, or soil disinfectants. They follow this basic principle even when farming fruit, which requires minimal control, and apply safe pesticides less than six times a year, except for 100 banned pesticides that are classified as highly toxic and carcinogenic. Our producers don’t mind doing the hard work of cutting grass and catching bugs.\nSnails and ducks are used to control paddy weeds and pests, and natural enemies are used to prevent the spread of aphids. We use eco-friendly organic materials such as lime Bordeaux to prevent pests, and some of them are made by ourselves, such as perilla oil and egg yolk oil. We do not use imported materials, even if they are certified by the government as eco-friendly materials.\nIt’s more costly and time-consuming than chemical pesticides, but Hansalim producers are willing to take the hard road because of their mission to save lives and produce healthy food.",

The manure from the cows is composted and reused for farming. The free-range eggs are also fed home-grown grass fodder, and the manure is returned to the farm for composting.\nWe use resources from the regions and communities we farm with to create a cycle of farming and animal husbandry that reduces waste and sustains the environment.",

Paprika, tomatoes, chillies, etc. can be found in the market all year round. However, Hansalim prioritises the seasonality of its products, and seasonal production of even the same eco-friendly agricultural products is fundamental. Therefore, except in exceptional cases, such as to prevent freezing in the winter, Hansalim does not use fossil fuels to raise the temperature inside the greenhouse to grow crops.\nInstead, they use blankets, non-woven fabrics, and other materials to keep the crops warm, and they use ?hydroponics?, which circulates groundwater over the greenhouse to increase the indoor temperature. Instead of boilers and warmers, the goods are grown naturally by the producers’ labour and care, and are delivered in sequence, taking into account cold and warm regions, and then discontinued at the end of the growing season.\nProduce that’s grown under its own power, withstanding the cold, is not only full of life and ripe at the right time, but it’s also truly eco-friendly, as no greenhouse gases are emitted during the growing process.",

In the case of apples, a hormone called ‘smart treatment’ inhibits the ethylene present in apples, giving them a crisp texture that can be stored for a long time.\nHansalim does not allow the use of hormones because we do not know how they will affect our bodies as they are involved in the physiology of the plant, and we believe that produce grown in a natural way is healthier to eat. Hormones may make the fruit open and look bigger and better without the need for bees to pollinate, but they often result in no seeds or grooves in the fruit and low density.\nA bee flies around, pollinates and ripens fruit under its own power, which comes to us without any artificial post-processing.\nHansalim’s produce is densely textured and full of natural flavours and aromas.",

Hansalim Participatory Certification.\n\n\n\nParticipatory Guarantee System\n\n\nEco-friendly farming is the use of no or minimal synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilisers, etc. for a healthy ecosystem and environment. Hansalim producers have been practising eco-friendly farming since the beginning of Hansalim. Since then, with the introduction of the national eco-certification system, words such as organic and pesticide-free have been expanded, but the eco-friendliness of farming has been focused on inspection results and safety, such as the absence of harmful substances, rather than a series of processes and efforts to save the land.\nHansalim wants to go beyond this eco-friendly certification system and introduce participatory certification, which grants certification based on the entire production process. In participatory certification, the production community conducts its own inspections, and a frequent inspection team composed of producers, members, and practitioners visits the farming site to find out what is lacking and make improvements together.\nThis year, a total of 26 production communities are participating in participatory certification, and we hope to gradually expand it from next year and establish it as a certification system unique to Hansalim that can realize the values of the life-saving movement.",
