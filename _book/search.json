    "text": "Preface\nIn 1844, a group of weavers from Rochdale in England set up a small cooperative store on Toad Lane. Now referred to as the Rochdale Pioneers, their practical response to the misery inflicted on the poor by the industrial revolution became a touchstone for a rapidly growing movement of working class people empowering themselves through cooperation and grassroots democracy. What began as a multitude of local practical answers to the worsening crises of capitalist industrialisation in Britain, France, Germany and beyond soon became an international movement of economic democratisation that transformed the lives and communities of countless peoples around the world. Credit unions, farmer, worker and consumer cooperatives grew into huge federations wielding significant economic power and which included women as equal voting members decades before women won the right to vote in national or local elections. These cooperative organisations championed food safety and quality standards, fair prices, decent wages and working conditions and democratic management long before these ideas became part of mainstream conversation or legislation.\nThe modern cooperative movement that grew from these social innovations among the working classes in nineteenth century Britain and Europe is now a global movement encompassing around 12% of the world’s population. Represented by its own international organisation, the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA), the movement brings together a huge diversity of cooperative enterprises across almost all sectors of social and economic life. As legal forms of organisation, cooperatives, credit unions and other types of mutual associations have become remarkably successful at providing economic stability for their members in the face of the recurring crises of global capitalism. These successes, however, only partly reflect the original ambitions of the early cooperators, who dreamt of inspiring a complete transformation of society out of the chaos of contemporary capitalism and into a Utopian order of cooperation that would benefit the whole of humanity. Now that the UN and other international organisations have begun to reflect on the legacy and future of cooperativism from the perspective of environmental sustainability and social development, those earlier dreams of systemic change have taken on a new significance.\nThe present crises of climate and ecosystem breakdown, worsening pollution and socio-economic inequality and the rapid loss of trust in politics and institutions have prompted many to seek to recover the radical values of cooperativism and reinterpret them, often with a post-capitalist slant. To provide a coherent framing for these efforts, the idea of ‘New Cooperativism’ has come to be used to refer to cooperative projects which emphasise common good orientation, multistakeholder participation, a transformative stance against the status quo and a commitment to participatory democratic governance. These so-called ‘New Cooperatives’ are emerging all over the world as a new kind of social enterprise aimed at creating fairer and more sustainable ways of meeting peoples need for food, housing, energy, transportation, social and health care and to provide new contexts for community building and cultural renewal.\nAmong these essential sectors, food systems present perhaps the most complex and difficult contexts for change as they connect an intricate and global network of producers, processors, distributors, consumers, government ministries, research systems, multinational corporations, hospitality businesses, caterers and local retailers, among many other actors whose perceptions and practices are shaped by diverse and deep-rooted cultural traditions and sharply competing interests. The need for change is also extremely urgent. Contemporary industrialised food systems involve the extravagant use of non-renewable energy and toxic inputs manufactured from rapidly depleting fossil fuels to produce highly processed foods that cause multiple negative impacts on human health, all while polluting the environment, degrading ecosystems, driving pandemic risk from zoonotic spillover, and generating massive quantities of greenhouse gases. Neither do farmers themselves derive much livelihood security from this arrangement but rather face a constant downward pressure on incomes that is made worse by the growing impacts of an unpredictable and increasingly volatile climate and market. It is perhaps only from within the boardrooms of multinational food companies and agribusiness that the twentieth century approach to food and farming appears remotely defensible. The only remaining justification for the status quo is the share prices of profit-driven companies and hedge funds engaged in controlling and manipulating the production and trade of food as a commodity or as the basis of financial derivatives and futures.\nIt seems unlikely that change will occur from the top down. Or if it does, it is even less likely that such change will be for the benefit of the majority of farmers and consumers. So the question is, as a growing grassroots movement for economic democracy and mutual aid, what contribution might ‘New Cooperatives’ make to transforming food systems from the bottom up?\nThis is a question I have been thinking and talking about for nearly 5 years now. By taking a deep dive into the past and present of the Hansalim Life Movement in South Korea – one of the most successful and least known multistakeholder cooperatives in organic food and farming – I want to suggest some possible answers.\nThe first reason for choosing to study Hansalim is that it seems to me to embody the same values and aspirations of the ‘New Cooperatives’ as well as displaying some other features not normally associated with examples of New Cooperativism that have so far been studied. That makes it interesting as a case study from which to reflect on the ideas and initiatives that are associated with New Cooperativism in other contexts – which currently are drawn mostly from Europe, North and South America. The second reason is the size and scope of Hansalim as both a movement and a federation of diverse democratic organisations. The fact that such a large cooperative enterprise has been created in the organic food sector in an advanced industrialised country by small scale producers and consumers working together is remarkable. The final reason is the longevity of Hansalim. The Hansalim Life Movement will be 40 years old in 2025 and its roots go back even further to the 1960s. The ability for such a project not only to grow, but to resist the pressure of conforming to capitalist markets, degenerating, splitting or succumbing to demutualisation implies a certain degree of resilience and confirms that Hansalim is not just a niche experiment but a mature movement. From the perspective of New Cooperativism, Hansalim represents a rare and previously unrecognised example of a mature large-scale New Cooperative in organic food; one that brings together producers and consumers in a way that is normally thought impossible or at least highly impractical.\nWith this in mind, I applied for a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Global Fellowship in 2019 to lead a research project with the University of Sussex in partnership with Hansalim’s Mosim and Salim Research Institute in Korea.\nFor four years, since moving to South Korea in 2020, I have been involved in research about and with Hansalim. As a proof reader, I assisted the translation of the Hansalim Manifesto into English in 2021 at which point I also began my 3 year Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellowship to investigate the Hansalim Life Movement. As a researcher I am interested not only in the practicalities and organisational structure of Hansalim as a cooperative but also the history of the movement, the philosophy in which it is rooted and the experiences of the individual members of this unique community. This book introduces the story of Hansalim, explains what it is today and describes Hansalim’s fascinating journey from its roots in the pro-democracy movement in 1960s Korea to becoming a national Federation of Life Cooperatives. The material for this book is drawn from interviews conducted between 2022-2024 and Korean language materials collected over the same period, including academic papers, books and reports published by Hansalim, and archived materials held by the Mosim and Salim Research Institute.\nAlthough the writing process for this book began in the second year of my project, the amount of material and the complexity and richness of Hansalim as movement and federation of multiple organisations, each with their own histories, has meant that I still have a long way to go to complete it! I have chosen to publish the book in serial form online (i.e. one chapter at a time as each chapter is completed). My reason for doing this is that I want to make up for the current lack of English language information about Hansalim as fast as possible. I believe the story and experience of Hansalim will be of great interest to those in Europe seeking to transform food systems from the grassroots. So in this ‘first edition’ I present the introduction and chapter 1 along with two appendices of materials translated from original blog posts by Hansalim that will be of special interest to farmers. Together, this material is what I expect to be most useful for practitioners in Europe seeking a straightforward introduction to what Hansalim is. The later chapters will include some more detailed history and explanation of the philosophy behind Hansalim as well as personal stories of Hansalim members. Finally, I intend to write one or two chapters that draw out specific lessons for contexts beyond Korea.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship grant agreement No 892403 between September 2021 and August 2024.

    "text": "Imagine a food system which belongs entirely to the people growing, processing and consuming its products and which is designed not for profit but for permanence. Perhaps instead of maximising profits for shareholders its goal would be to build lasting relationships of trust and mutual care between rural and urban communities based on a shared responsibility for the future. Food would no longer be a commodity; the price of which is set by the ‘hidden hand’ of the market. It could perhaps become a symbol of mutual dependence, valued for the labour required to produce it while caring for the lifeworlds of the nonhumans whose continuing flourishing is the ultimate source of our own survival. Is such a system possible? If so, how would it be done and has it ever been tried at scale before?\nIf such an alternative had been successfully created in a modern industrialised society it would surely be known around the world and be the object of numerous studies and reports to understand how it could be expanded and replicated elsewhere. Unless, that is, it existed in such an unexpected place that no-one thought to look for it there, or when they saw it they didn’t know what they were really looking at.\nThese days most people associate South Korea with its wildly popular cultural products - BTS, Black Pink, K-drama and more recently K-food. And before K-pop, South Korea was best known for its miraculous economic transformation from rural backwater to industrial powerhouse. From a poverty stricken and divided nation in the 1950s, the country developed so rapidly that it has become an archetype of supercharged capitalist industrialisation. In just 4 decades it built a dynamic economy that boasts global brands such as Samsung, Kia and LG. However, these economic and cultural achievements are only part of the story of South Korean development.\nSince the early 1960s, as South Korea’s autocratic government was embarking on a program of rapid state-led industrialisation, a counter-movement of pro-democracy activists and organic farmers began to form credit unions and cooperatives to create networks of mutual support and solidarity among those who were suffering the worst effects of economic dislocation and oppression. By the 1980s there were thousands of these democratic economic communities all over the country and, when democratization finally began in 1987, they were poised to form the basis of Korea’s thriving civil society. The most visible of these were the huge consumer cooperative federations - Hansalim, Dure, HappyCOOP and iCOOP - which nurtured the growth of Korea’s organic food and farming sector and which continue to pursue important social innovations in multiple sectors of Korean economy and society. Although in English language literature they are commonly referred to as ‘consumer cooperatives’, they are somewhat different from the well known European and American cooperatives that many of us in the west have grown up with. They are so different, in fact, that I think the term ‘consumer cooperative’ is simply misleading and hides a much more complex reality. Let me show you what I mean.\nIn Seoul and many other cities all across South Korea there are shops with the name ‘Hansalim’ on their facades, 240 of them in total. They are run by democratic communities of local consumers and in these shops you can buy fresh fruit and vegetables, eggs, meat, rice and other grains. They also sell kimchi, oils and soy sauce and everything necessary for cooking in addition to a multitude of other preserved and processed foods from snacks to teas and herbal medicines. Alongside food items you can also purchase eco-friendly soaps and cosmetics and simple clothing and cooking utensils among a range of other household items. All of these products are made without artificial additives and through organic and eco-friendly methods by self-organised rural communities who adhere to an agreed set of standards on quality, safety and ecological protection. With a few exceptions, all are produced in Korea and sold at annually fixed prices agreed in advance by producers and consumers to ensure a fair and stable income for farmers.\nThe consumer and producer communities responsible set up the first store in 1986 and published a Manifesto in 1989 which described their goal as the transformation of society from a civilisation of killing to a civilisation of life in which we learn to live together with one another and with the non-human world in symbiotic relationships of mutual care. Nearly 40 years on, Hansalim has become a national multistakeholder federation of consumer and producer cooperatives which not only operates a comprehensive alternative food system but also funds a whole range of other activities to promote the Hansalim Life Movement as a grassroots democratic project for societal and cultural change through education, publishing, research, environmental campaigning, charitable aid and peer-to-peer financing.\nAnd so, in the most unexpected place - one of the most advanced and ruthlessly capitalist industrial economies in the world - hidden behind our preconceived notion of a modern ‘consumer cooperative’ is a successful 40 year old experiment in creating a self-sustaining, democratically managed, solidarity-based, comprehensive food system that upholds the goals of protecting and regenerating ecosystems while providing decent and stable livelihoods and healthy, nutritious food that is priced according not to its worth on the market but its true value. So perhaps Hansalim can also become for us in Europe and beyond, a prototype for what is possible and a seed of inspiration.\nWhere did Hansalim come from? What is it today and how does it work? And what might we in Europe learn from Hansalim’s experience as we try to transform our own food systems? These are the questions this book seeks to answer.",

    "text": "1.1 A movement, a manifesto, a business\nIn 1986 pro-democracy protesters were out in the streets fighting with police and trying to escape tear gas.1 Since seizing power in a military coup in 1961, General Park Chung-hee presided over 18 years of military rule. Following his assassination in 1979 and another coup, General Chun Doo-hwan installed himself as president, leading what was essentially a continuation of the military regime in the face of growing mass protests calling for democratic government.2\nIn the midst of such turmoil, a small group of farmers and housewives opened a small rice store in the centre of Seoul. In light of the chaotic political situation, this looked like a foolish and insignificant action. However, the creation of that first store, called Hansalim Nongsan, was actually a radical act of resistance and hope in the face of political uncertainty. The men and women who opened Hansalim Nongsan belonged to a small cooperative of producers and consumers in a city called Wonju, about an hour away from Seoul, and that store represented a first step in launching an ecological alternative movement that had been gathering support in Wonju and beyond since the late 1970s. It’s founders where known as the Wonju Group.\nThe Wonju Group were a diverse collection of Catholic Farmers, urban housewives, pro-democracy activists, artists, poets and scholars who had been involved in the credit union movement in Wonju that was founded in the 1960s. They had witnessed the fundamentally destructive tendencies of capitalist and socialist industrialisation and they were looking for an alternative in the cooperative movement. However, they recognised that cooperatives were also vulnerable to the same fundamental mistake that lay at the heart of industrial civilization. That mistake was to assume a materialist, mechanistic view of the world which viewed humans and all life as replaceable parts in the machine of economic growth. It was this worldview, they argued, that gave rise to the characteristics of domination, alienation, separation and oppression in modern society.\nAs an alternative, they proposed a worldview founded on the sacredness and interconnectedness of all life. The first version of this worldview or eco-philosophy was outlined in the Wonju Report in 1982. As the movement began to grow the Wonju Group set up the first Life Cooperative in Wonju in 1985 and the Hansalim Nongsan rice store a year later.3 In this way, the Wonju Coop formally brought together organic farming and direct trade with the equal participation of consumers and producers. Soon after, the Hansalim Community Consumers Union was set-up in Seoul with 70 members to trade directly with the Hansalim Producers Association that was set up with 70 farming households. Next, the Wonju Group hosted a year long process of study and discussion to develop the Hansalim Manifesto which was published in 1989 and which formally launched the Hansalim Life Movement.\nFrom this small beginning, the movement quickly expanded as other cooperatives and farming communities joined from across the country and consumer membership grew. By 1990 there were four Life Cooperatives with over 5,500 members and within just over another 10 years membership had grown to over 40,000. That is when things really began to take off and by 2008 there were 19 Life Cooperatives managing 84 stores for their 170,000 members. In 2023 Hansalim’s 27 Life Cooperatives and 15 Producer Federations handled annual sales of 485,066 million KRW (324.3 million euros) through 240 stores, an online store and a mobile app.4 From these sales, 330,610 million KRW (221 million euros) were returned to the 136 producer communities. That is nearly 70%! So what kind of business model has Hansalim created that provides those returns to producers while covering the shared business operations and funding a whole range of movement activities from the remaining 30%? And what lies at the heart of this unusual way of doing business?\n(Graph of growth)",

    "section": "1.2 Built on a relationship of mutual care",
    "text": "1.2 Built on a relationship of mutual care\nAt its simplest, the Hansalim Life Movement is a relationship of mutual care and responsibility between rural and urban communities. The core of Hansalim’s approach is expressed in this phrase: “Let the producer take responsibility for sustaining the consumer’s life and the consumer for sustaining the producer’s livelihood”.5 However, this mutual responsibility is about much more than simply direct sales as it also encompasses a shared commitment to protecting and restoring ecosystems and working for wider social and cultural change towards justice and peace.\nThis expansive goal is captured by the name itself: “Hansalim” (한살림).\nThe first part of the word, ‘Han’ (한) contains two sets of paradoxical meanings. It expresses, firstly, a paradoxical double sense of being collectively one and individually one and, secondly, of spreading out as one and gathering in as one.6 In ancient Korean philosophy ‘Han’ refers to the divine Spirit or life of the universe which permeates all things living and inanimate and integrates the universe into an evolving cosmos.\nThe word ‘Salim’ (살림) has two related meanings. The first is ‘housekeeping’ which implies parental care, homemaking, food preparation, hospitality. It is perhaps the most practical of all human activities and is the bedrock of human survival and flourishing. The second meaning develops from this practical sense the philosophical concept of ‘nurturing’ which has the connotation of saving and restoring, bringing back to life, vivifying.7\nSo we see that the word ‘Hansalim’ expresses a relationship and an action. It encompasses the goal of nurturing or reviving all things, that is bringing all into a flourishing shared life together. In fact, the word ‘Hansalim’ is often used as a verb as when members encourage each other by saying “let’s Hansalim!”\nAmong Hansalim members, the word “Salim” is used to express their purpose in all their activities. So the collective mission of Hansalim is summed up in four phrases that each incorporate this word Salim.\nThe first, ‘Nurturing Food’ (밥상살림 — bapsang-salim) refers to the goal of providing consumers with safe, healthy, eco-friendly food and other household goods and this defines the responsibility that producers adopt for the life of consumers. The word in Korean directly translates as nurturing the dining table and the significance of this is that it refers to the act of sharing a meal, not simply consuming food. Second, ‘Nurturing Agriculture’ (농업살림 — nongup-salim) refers to the goal of securing stable and sustainable livelihoods for producers and this defines the responsibility which consumers adopt for the livelihoods of producers. Third, ‘Nurturing Life’ (생명살림 — saengmyeong-salim) expresses the responsibility of care for others (human and non-human) which producers and consumers together share and which is worked out through outward focused activities such as promoting eco-friendly farming, environmental campaigning, education, social welfare projects, and inward contemplative and reflective practices. Finally, ‘Nurturing Community’ (지역살림 — jiyeok-salim), emphasises the need to strengthen local community resources and relationships and to reach out to neighbours in need.\nSo how these values put into practice? I’m going to tackle this question from bottom up, first from the rural or producer perspective and then from the urban or consumer perspective before describing the alternative economic system that brings them together.",

    "text": "1.3 In the form of a multistakeholder cooperative\nThe producer community is the smallest level of organization in Hansalim. In these communities farming is done together by a group of family farms who partner with one another to plan and coordinate their production, share knowledge and labour, and manage shared facilities and equipment. To join Hansalim as a producer, you would join one of these communities and receive training in eco-friendly farming and Hansalim’s production and processing standards.\nThere are 136 producer communities which cultivate a total of 11,300 acres. In addition to the producer communities there are 110 processing units which process raw materials from Hansalim’s producers as well as seafood and other products from local organic and environmentally friendly sources.8 The producer organizations are brought together into 15 regional federations with their own elected representatives which together form Hansalim’s National Producer Federation with their own elected president and employed staff. Many of these regional federations pool resources to run local distribution hubs with their own processing facilities and some have created complex systems to process and re-circulate farm wastes as inputs between multiple local farms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Producer Community in Byeonsan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByeonsan Producer Community shared facilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Producer Community in Jeju, head office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Producer Community in Asan, distribution hub\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you join Hansalim as a consumer you become a member of your local Life Cooperative (one among 27 as of 2024). The word “Life” is significant because these cooperatives are not like the conventional consumer cooperatives that you would encounter in Europe or America. Their focus is not only responsible consumption but also seeking to live together in solidarity with one another and with producers and rural communities. Each Life Cooperative in Hansalim is a democratic autonomous organization formed by members to carry out collective activities, set-up and run Hansalim stores, organize charitable, cultural and educational activities and the joint activities between rural producers and urban consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeju Hansalim Life Coop office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeju Hansalim community kitchen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeju Hansalim community permaculture garden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusan Hansalim community kitchen\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, the producer communities and federations and the Life Coops form a federation of cooperatives, associations and businesses linked together through a shared business federation and the Hansalim Federation with its support organisations including a research institute, charitable foundation, solar power coop, publishing house, training institute and peer-to-peer finance platform.

    "section": "1.4 Creating an alternative economy",
    "text": "1.4 Creating an alternative economy\nIn simple terms, the Hansalim business model can be described as a contract-based direct sales arrangement in which prices and quantities are agreed annually in advance by producers and consumers with support from Hansalim’s professional staff. However, it is also very flexible in ways that are designed to support the needs of producers.\n\nA system designed for producers\nThere are four key features of Hansalim’s business model. Firstly: flexibility of production. Hansalim’s production system allows for a relatively wide range of production philosophies and techniques among member producers to ensure that producers have maximum autonomy. For example, one producer community might prefer a relatively simple style of organic farming with a small number of crops while another aspires to build a complex system of circulating agriculture with a large diversity of crops and livestock supported by recycling of farm wastes from one part of the system as inputs to others. Still others, especially fruit producers, might find it impossible to grow without a limited use of safe pesticides. A dogmatic insistence on a single farming philosophy would exclude many farmers who might be unable to follow a one-size-fits-all system in the face of local conditions or other resource constraints. Hansalim’s more flexible approach removes a significant barrier to entry for farmers who would otherwise need to spend a long time learning new techniques before starting to earn an income. This brings the added advantage that farmers who want to transition from conventional to organic farming can do so in a staged process while still making a living. However, it also creates a problem. How to maintain the trust of consumers when the diversity of production techniques is so wide?\nThis brings us to the second feature of Hansalim’s business model: simple and honest labeling. Transparency with consumer members is ensured through Hansalim’s own labelling system. Products are labelled under four main categories:\n\nOrganic (which would include conventional organic, permaculture and EM techniques);\nPesticide-free (when crop types and local conditions make it non-viable to exclude use of fertilizers);\nLow pesticide (for certain fruit crops which would be prohibitively difficult to grow without a limited use of pesticides);\nDomestic (for miscellaneous grains such as wheat or barley which are used as raw ingredients in some processed goods).\n\nFor all four categories Hansalim’s standards are stricter than the national safety standards and products are tested regularly for residues, contaminants and radiation as appropriate to protect trust between consumers and producers.\nTo complement the flexibility and transparency of production methods the third feature - flexibility of supply - enhances the autonomy of producers and provides some added resilience to the system. Hansalim producers are not locked-in to exclusive supply contracts but have the freedom to supply whatever proportion of their crop to Hansalim they wish while simultaneously supplying through other channels such as government purchasing schemes for school meals. This applies to each producer community and also to each member of each community. So one farmer might supply 30% of their produce to Hansalim through their community while selling the rest through local government procurement for school meals. Or a producer community might sell Hansalim branded grapes through the Hansalim Federation while selling grape juice through another market under their own brand.\nFinally, for an additional level of flexibility, the contract-based system is supplemented by demand-based supply arrangements to allow greater flexibility for producers.\nTaken together, these four features of Hansalim’s business model mean that, within and between producer communities the level of specialization or circular integration and the combination of sales channels are all decided by the producers themselves. This makes for an astonishingly diverse range of production operations each tailored to the local soil and climate conditions and preferences of producers themselves, while ensuring a stable guaranteed income to as many farmers as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word ‘Hansalim’ written in life alongside a rice paddy on Our Seed Farm in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRice terraces on Our Seed Farm in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lowland rice paddy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanting out rice seedlings with a Hansalim producer community in Paju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVinyl house (polytunnel greenhouse) crops at Our Seed Farm in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrapes growing in a vinyl house at a Hansalim producer community in Okcheon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA vegetable field at Nunbisan, a Hansalim producer community in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA field of oats at Nunbisan grown for chicken feed and as an ingredient for making various types of Hansalim products that are processed on site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking home made organic fertilizer from Chicken faeces and crop waste on Nunbisan farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA green manure cover crop at Nunbisan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken sheds on Nunbisan farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside Nunbisan’s chicken sheds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing mushrooms on a Hansalim farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn orchard on a Hansalim farm on Jeju Island\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowland farming at the foot of a mountain in Byeonsan at the Sandle-pada Hansalim Producer Community\n\n\nThese images show just a tiny snapshot of some of the different farming landscapes, crops and approaches which form Hansalim’s complex agricultural systems. The system of labelling helps provide a sense of order to this complexity for the sake of Hansalim’s consumer members and also facilitates the progression of Hansalim producers further away from conventional farming methods towards progressively more eco-friendly alternatives. Let’s look at the overall share of production according to production type, crop type and supply type. The following graph shows the flow of goods by tons.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Flow of production quantities by type, crop and contract in 2023 (tons)\n\n\nOn the left you can see the four labelled production types of organic, pesticide-free, low-pesticide and domestic. In the centre, the crop types are divided into vegetables, staple grains, roots and tubers, fruit, and miscellaneous grains. On the right, crop types are categorized into supply type as either contract-based or demand-based supply. If you interact with the graph you can see the number of tons of each combination. The majority of production is organic and this accounts for most of the vegetable cultivation, almost all staple grains and root and tubers. These crop types are almost entirely supplied on a contract-basis. Pesticide-free production accounts for some vegetable supply, a fraction of staple grains and some fruit crops. It is in fruit cultivation that higher proportion of crops are cultivated according to ‘low-pesticide’ standards. This is because many fruit crops are especially vulnerable to pests and would no be viable for producers without some use of non-synthetic pesticides. Miscellaneous grains are mostly produced under the domestic label and supplied on a demand-basis.\nSo what happens to the revenue from these sales? As I mentioned above, until recently, with margins well below 30%, Hansalim was able to return 73% or more of the product price to the producers. Now, following several years of rising costs and worsening impacts of climate change the margin has come under increasing pressure and currently stands at just over 31% which leaves almost 69% for producers. This table shows the breakdown of what the margin covers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivision\nRate\nSubdivision\nRate\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Federation\n0.81%\nSubscription feesService revenue\n0.55%0.26%\n\n\nHansalim Business Federation\n8.86%\nBusiness share rateProduction Support FundPrice Stabilisation Fund\n8.61%0.165%0.085%\n\n\nMember Life Coops\n21.70%\nRegional Margin Rate Production Stabilisation Fund\n21.60%0.10%\n\n\nGross margin rate (GPR)\n31.37%\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is virtually the reverse of conventional market distribution which usually takes a 50 - 70% margin. So what does this distribution of revenue look like from the point of view of the Life Coops, producers and the federal organisations? The following chart shows the flow of value (in euros) from the sales of goods (on the left) through each Life Coop (center) to the share of revenue provided to each category of organization (right).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Flow of value from sales revenue through each Life Coop to other organizations (euros)\n\n\nYou will notice that the vast majority of sales are of ‘federation goods’ which are those supplied through the business federation’s distribution channels. A much smaller percentage of sales are accounted for by so-called ‘local goods’ which are supplied independently from Hansalim’s central distribution system. The central column of the chart looks a bit messy, but the point is that the majority of sales are through shops managed by the Life Coops in Seoul and Gyeonggi (the province surrounding Seoul) which together form the largest and densest population centre in Korea. On the right hand side you can see that the share of revenue returned to producers is by far the largest, while the margin covers the budgets of the Life Coops and finally the Business Federation and the Hansalim Federation.\nThis distribution revenue is achieved through a combination of:\n\nRecovered costs from distribution by removing the multiple opportunities from profit gauging by intermediaries;\nPrices set to reflect the true costs of production; and\nEconomies of scope and scale achieved through shared business activities and collectively owned capital at local, regional and national levels.\n\nAfter providing for producers’ livelihoods, what then does the remaining 30% pay for?\n\n\nA different kind of consumer experience\nThe largest portion (21.7%) goes to the Life Coops themselves to cover the costs of running stores, handling local distribution and their various educational, participation and engagement activities. Life Coops are autonomous member owned businesses which run the Hansalim stores in their local areas. They decide when and where to open new stores, how to manage them and how to organize local distribution options such as home delivery. Stores are usually run by an employed manager and the Life Coop’s Store Activists (consumer members who are trained and paid to staff the stores) and products are ordered through the Hansalim Business Federation and delivered from their national logistics centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Seoul Hansalim, Yangju Store (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Seoul Hansalim, Ssangmoon Store with home delivery vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside a Hansalim Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wide-angle view inside a Hansalim Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Store and Food Culture Center at Jeju head office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the store at the Jeju Hansalim head office\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Hansalim store you can buy virtually everything you need from food to household goods and even cosmetics. Almost all these products are made by Hansalim producers and processors with a few exceptions for some household items and a handful of fair trade products. Hansalim branded sales through the business federation are supplemented by local goods sourced by each store according to the decision of each Life Coop. What this means is that there is usually just one type of everything you need rather than multiple brands of the same product so the shop size is relatively small compared to a regular supermarket. Here are a few examples of the products that are available in my local Hansalim store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim Rice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweet potatoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFruit and vegetables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTofu and other ingredients for cooking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDairy products and other chilled processed goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast cereals and flour etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrozen meats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottled juice, preserves and other ingredients in jars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabbages for making Kimchi (these are distributed over a period of a week or two each November in time for ‘Kimjang’ when families and communities gather to make Kimchi together)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady meals! Frozen foods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favourites, traditionally made rice wine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even by cosmetics made by Hansalim with eco-friendly natural ingredients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold cleaning products are also available including toilet paper and kitchen paper made in Hansalim’s Anseong logistics centre from recycled milk and drinks cartons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a small number of Fair Trade goods from select partners in other countries such as Olive Oil and chocolate\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim stores also differ from a conventional supermarket in another way. They often provide the venue for member activities and encounters between consumers and producers facilitated by the Life Coop’s Organizing Activists (members who are trained and paid to organize opportunities for consumers and producers to meet each other and share food and other activities together). From the beginning of Hansalim, relationship building among consumers and between consumers and producers has been a top priority.\n\n\n\nAn activity room inside a Hansalim Store showing the small kitchen, library and meeting space\n\n\nThere are various ways consumers can build community together and participate in the livelihoods of producers. Neighbourhood meetings and small groups provide a context for consumer members to learn and build relationships through reading groups, cooking classes, social activities, and environmental activism etc. ‘Helping hands’ visits are organized by Activists to bring members to help producers with farming activities such as planting, weeding and harvest and to join in with traditional rural rituals and share meals together. Community work is also an important shared activity in which members and producers raise money for charitable causes, donate food to people in need and provide education and support to marginalized groups. Consumers often visit the producer communities for local festivals or just to see the farm, share a meal and get to know each other. Producers also visit stores to introduce their new products and many develop special relationships with particular Life Coops as well as participating in Hansalim conferences and multistakeholder committees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visit to Nunbisan farm by Life Coop members\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing a meal during the visit to Nunbisan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Coop members visiting the rice fields at Our Seed Farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining in with planting out rice seedlings on Hansalim farm in Paju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA traditional ceremony showing respect to the land\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing food together as part of the ceremony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing stories after the ceremony and rice planting activity in Paju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA ‘helping hands’ activity at a Hansalim farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim producers and consumer members participating in a conference organised by the Hansalim Food Life Education Centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA gathering of North Seoul Hansalim Organisational Activists to share ideas and prepare for the year ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA ‘yard sale’ to raise money for charity organised by Hansalim Activists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA national research forum organised by Wonju Hansalim Life Coop\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of these activities are supported by funds allocated in the budgets of the Life Coops and the Hansalim Federation which ultimately come from their combined sales. The chart below gives you an idea of the amount of interaction between consumers and producers in the course of a single year. It shows the number of ‘person-visits’ categorized by each Life Coop and by the type of activity in 2023. Exchange refers to activities involving interaction between producers and consumers and engagement refers to activities among consumers themselves. You can see that there were around 59,000 encounters between individuals in 2023 that were directly facilitated by Hansalim’s member Life Coops. Although many of these are repeat visits of individuals (so the total number of people involved will be somewhat less) you still get a sense of the sheer scale of relationship building that is going on within Hansalim.\n\n\n\nParticipation in 2023: engagement among consumers and exchanges between consumers and producers\n\n\nIn addition to selling to members and organizing member activities, Life Coops also engage with the wider community by running a whole range of educational activities and training, community kitchens, environmental campaigns and community building activities and some have also set up new cooperatives in solar power and in the care sector. On top of all these activities, the high point of Hansalim’s cultural life are the festivals which are held at national and local levels. For example, the Autumn festivals bring producers and consumers together for food, drinking and traditional games and dancing. They provide a special context for making friends and creating a sense of shared identity and camaraderie.\n\n\n\nCelebration Festival at Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDancing at the festival in Goesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutumn harvest festival in Goesan (in the foreground is the rope used for the mass tug-of-war game!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHansalim flag flying among the dancers at the Autumn festival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe being prepared for the giant tug-of-war game\n\n\n\n\n\nFor consumers and producers then, there is a lot of fun to be had as a member of a Hansalim community. This is a vitally important part of the rhythm of hard work broken up by fantastic celebrations and informal contexts for relaxation together. None of this would be possible, however, without the hard and often hidden work of the Practitioners.\n\n\nThe special role of practitioners\nIn Hansalim, employees are referred to as ‘practitioners.’ They are the people who make it possible to put the producer-consumer relationship into practice by running the businesses, coordinating movement activities and organizing the many processes that are required to keep each member organization running and working together as a federation. They are not only professionals in logistics, marketing, strategy etc. but they also act as mediators between consumer and producer members and their organizations. Whereas a manager in a corporate enterprise might be able to focus solely on negotiating financial dealings with clients and suppliers, Hansalim practitioners often find themselves also negotiating the complex conflicts in values and expectations between Hansalim members, making their role especially difficult and important.\nThe largest employer of practitioners within Hansalim is the Business Federation which takes the next largest share of revenue after the Life Coops (8.86%) to cover the costs of labour, logistics, promotion and marketing, product development etc. One of the most important asset managed by the business federation is the Anseong Logistics Centre.\n\n\n\nHansalim’s Anseong logistics and processing centre\n\n\nFinally, the smallest share of the margin (0.81%) is used to fund the Hansalim Federation which organizes the national-level governance and policy-making processes, supports Hansalim’s educational, cultural, publishing, research and charitable activities, coordinates collaboration and solidarity activities with others in Korea and abroad, and provides support to the member Life Coops.\nIn 2023 there were a total of 291 practitioners working in the member Life Coops, a further 235 working for the Business Federation and 40 at the Hansalim Federation. These were supplemented by 1,396 Activists working in the stores and to organize member activities. Together with the 3,579 producers and processors they generate enough revenue to support themselves and the broader collective efforts of the Hansalim Life Movement to bring about social and cultural change towards a more sustainable way of living.\nWith such a large and complex organisation, you might think that there must be some strong central authority controlling everything from the top down and making sure efficiency is maximised and operations meticulously coordinated. Happily (or perhaps sadly, depending on your point of view) that is not the case in Hansalim.",

    "text": "1.5 Governed through deliberative democracy\nBelow is a diagram of Hansalim’s various organizations and how they relate to each other, laid out in order of how authority is delegated from top to bottom. At the top are the individual members. The 890,000 Cooperator households and the 3,579 Producers. They are the owners of Hansalim. Below you can see the Life Coops, Producer Organizations and the Support Organizations and in the box labelled ‘Member Organisations Autonomous Activities’ I have listed the numbers of people involved. The word ‘Practitioner’ here is Hansalim’s term for employed staff member (as mentioned above). Remember that ‘Activists’ refers to consumer members paid to either organise producer-consumer activities or work in the stores. Between them, the member organisations elect a total of 212 delegates to the General Assembly of the Hansalim Federation (maximum two 1-year terms). The General Assembly elects a board of 36 directors including the chair of directors who holds the title of president (maximum two 2-year terms). The board appoints the executive directors of the Federation, the Business Federation and the support organizations but cannot interfere with the governance and management of the member Life Coops or producer organizations. The standing committees, conferences and steering committees are were deliberations take place over policy and strategy decisions and they operate at local and national level involving producers, consumers and employees.\n\n\n\nFederation\n\n\nSo you see that neither the Hansalim Federation nor the Business Federation are ‘apex’ organisations or ‘head offices’ but rather, they are supporting organisations whose purpose is to facilitate the successful business of the Life Coops and producer organisations while running the delegated shared movement activities and supporting the independent movement activities of member organisations. The way the Hansalim Federation sees itself in relation to the other Hansalim organisations can be understood with the help of the following diagram which was published in the Hansalim 2017 White Paper. I have reproduced it here with some minor modifications and translated it into English.\n\n\n\nlabel\n\n\nHansalim’s stakeholders include five categories: Producers, Cooperators (i.e. consumer members), Practitioners, Activists and the Local Community. Along with Producers, the Cooperators share the main responsibility for governance of the federation and their local associations and Life Coops. Cooperators are also expected to consume responsibly and participate in activities to support producers and help the local community.\nThe original role of Practitioners was to act as a bridge between producers and consumers while running the business activities. In the beginning people joined Hansalim as Practitioners to support their shared vision and often worked very long hours for low pay doing whatever was needed. Now, as Hansalim has grown larger, many of those who worked for Hansalim from the early days have taken on managerial positions while the hiring of new employees has become more formalized and specialized. As a consequence, the role of Practitioners as bridge between consumers and producers has become weaker and the emphasis has shifted towards running business operations.\nActivists were originally member volunteers whose role was to organize consumer activities and also act as a bridge with producers. After a while, it was decided that they should be financially compensated for their work and their roles should be more clearly specified. Now, Activists are members who have received training for specific roles and are paid a small amount of compensation to work in the stores, receive phone orders and organize various activities for producers and members.\nThe Local Community is included as a stakeholder category as producers, members and activists seek to identify and take action on local needs. They work with local community organizations and representatives of such organizations are also invited to participate on various councils as appropriate. In fact, it is quite common for Hansalim members and producers to simultaneously hold official positions in Hansalim and other local grassroots organizations and social enterprises.\nThe organizational role of Hansalim in this structure is to support each of these different stakeholders to realize their own and Hansalim’s values in their various activities.",

    "section": "1.6 Conclusion",
    "text": "1.6 Conclusion\nFor those in Europe and other regions of the world outside Korea, Hansalim can appear to be a uniquely Korean phenomenon. “Surely, it is only the collectivist culture of Korea that makes such a community possible. It could never succeed in our hyper-individualist western societies.” But you must not forget that the two strongest influences on contemporary Korean culture are Confucianism and American consumerism. The former provided the rationale for a strictly hierarchical and patriarchal culture that dominated Korean society for several hundred years before the latter collided head on with it during the post-war period, giving rise to a uniquely oppressive mixture of competitive consumerism and rigid conformism.\nIt was in this context that Hansalim emerged as a concrete expression of the desire felt among many at the time for a different kind of society built upon equality, mutual respect and care for other humans and the nonhuman world. I have a feeling that this same desire has not gone away, but only deepened, not only among Koreans but equally among contemporary people in Europe and beyond.\nHowever, no matter how much you desire to create something like Hansalim, managing such a large organization (or rather, federation of organisations) without a dictatorial head office but in a deliberative and democratic way is very, very hard work. If you were in it for the money, you would not do it like this. But for every member of Hansalim I have spoken to so far, its not about money, but about being part of a community dedicated to caring for each other and to creating a peaceful and thriving future for the world. So as a reader from outside Korea who aspires to transform food systems, you need to keep in mind that Hansalim’s success is mingled with failures and disappointments and comes at the cost of a great deal of personal sacrifice, collective conflict and agonising, trial and error and lots and lots and lots of ….. meetings.\nAssuming you are prepared for such a challenge, it is nevertheless not possible to simply transplant Hansalim’s model to other countries. It has its own history and unique context from which it emerged and it is not a static model but an evolving community in a continual process of change. But what is perhaps much more useful than a blueprint, is Hansalim’s story and the myriad stories of the people who practice Hansalim (as a verb). These stories carry the values of Hansalim, the spirit and emotion of Hansalim people and the experience of countless challenges and success that they faced along the way. These stories, more than anything else, carry the seeds that could produce new fruit in other contexts, as long as there are those with the determination to cultivate them.\nTo hear some of these stories, I am afraid you will have to wait a little longer for the rest of the book to be written and published. I’ll do my best to finish it as soon as possible! Each new chapter will be published here as soon as it is written.\nAnd of course, it is a story without an ending. Which means, in all likelihood, there are those among you reading this book who will end up playing a role in it one way or another.",

Production communities are the basic organisations responsible for the production and delivery of Hansalim products. The community plans how much of each crop will be grown in a given year.\nMostly village-based, farming communities live close to each other and meet monthly to produce and manage the crops they promised to their members. They exchange information on eco-friendly farming, welcome new members, and work together to promote the Hansalim movement in the community. To become a Hansalim producer, you must join a production community and receive education and guidance on the values and production standards of Hansalim through the community.\nEco-friendly farming is harder to do alone. Hansalim producers who practice life-saving farming are currently farming together in more than 130 farming communities across the country.\nHansalim farming is special even though it is eco-friendly. This is a series on the differences between Hansalim’s farming methods according to the Hansalim Production and Delivery Standard.",

This is known as a ‘separation distance’. The separation distance can be provided by a watercourse or road between the two fields. In the absence of these, a barrier of at least 1 metre in height must be erected, or if the terrain does not allow for a barrier to be erected, the barrier must be set back into the farmland and produce produced beyond it will not be supplied.\nIn addition to this, they plant taller crops alongside their fields, communicate frequently with neighbouring conventional farmers, and sometimes take responsibility for weeding the perimeter. Producers go to great lengths to keep pesticides out of their hard-earned green fields.",

It’s often added to fields before planting, or spread as a fertiliser when crops are growing.\nSome producers who need to grow seedlings make their own topsoil. The government’s eco-certification only requires that pesticides be tested in the final product, so it’s okay to use topsoil sprayed with chemical fertilisers to promote germination or pesticides to prevent viruses, but Hansalim starts with pesticide-free topsoil in which the tiny seeds grow.",

This is the principle of self-nurturing that Hansalim aims for.\nSprouting seeds is like awakening latent life, and we don’t know how many will sprout, or if they will grow into healthy seedlings, so we leave one greenhouse per household dedicated to nursery stock, sowing much more generously than we need.\nSprouted seedlings are much more sensitive to changing temperatures, moisture, and pests, so they need to be checked several times a day for temperature, watering, and bug control. It’s less work and less money to buy seedlings, but even with eco-friendly seedlings, you can’t be sure how they’ve been raised. Homegrown seedlings that have been tended to and grown under their own power for two to three months will produce stronger, healthier crops than those that have been sprouted with the help of chemicals to stimulate germination and prevent viruses.",

Hansalim producers do not use herbicides, growth regulators, or soil disinfectants. They follow this basic principle even when farming fruit, which requires minimal control, and apply safe pesticides less than six times a year, except for 100 banned pesticides that are classified as highly toxic and carcinogenic. Our producers don’t mind doing the hard work of cutting grass and catching bugs.\nSnails and ducks are used to control paddy weeds and pests, and natural enemies are used to prevent the spread of aphids. We use eco-friendly organic materials such as lime Bordeaux to prevent pests, and some of them are made by ourselves, such as perilla oil and egg yolk oil. We do not use imported materials, even if they are certified by the government as eco-friendly materials.\nIt’s more costly and time-consuming than chemical pesticides, but Hansalim producers are willing to take the hard road because of their mission to save lives and produce healthy food.",

The manure from the cows is composted and reused for farming. The free-range eggs are also fed home-grown grass fodder, and the manure is returned to the farm for composting.\nWe use resources from the regions and communities we farm with to create a cycle of farming and animal husbandry that reduces waste and sustains the environment.",

Paprika, tomatoes, chillies, etc. can be found in the market all year round. However, Hansalim prioritises the seasonality of its products, and seasonal production of even the same eco-friendly agricultural products is fundamental. Therefore, except in exceptional cases, such as to prevent freezing in the winter, Hansalim does not use fossil fuels to raise the temperature inside the greenhouse to grow crops.\nInstead, they use blankets, non-woven fabrics, and other materials to keep the crops warm, and they use ?hydroponics?, which circulates groundwater over the greenhouse to increase the indoor temperature. Instead of boilers and warmers, the goods are grown naturally by the producers’ labour and care, and are delivered in sequence, taking into account cold and warm regions, and then discontinued at the end of the growing season.\nProduce that’s grown under its own power, withstanding the cold, is not only full of life and ripe at the right time, but it’s also truly eco-friendly, as no greenhouse gases are emitted during the growing process.",

In the case of apples, a hormone called ‘smart treatment’ inhibits the ethylene present in apples, giving them a crisp texture that can be stored for a long time.\nHansalim does not allow the use of hormones because we do not know how they will affect our bodies as they are involved in the physiology of the plant, and we believe that produce grown in a natural way is healthier to eat. Hormones may make the fruit open and look bigger and better without the need for bees to pollinate, but they often result in no seeds or grooves in the fruit and low density.\nA bee flies around, pollinates and ripens fruit under its own power, which comes to us without any artificial post-processing.\nHansalim’s produce is densely textured and full of natural flavours and aromas.",

Hansalim Participatory Certification.\n\n\n\nParticipatory Guarantee System\n\n\nEco-friendly farming is the use of no or minimal synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilisers, etc. for a healthy ecosystem and environment. Hansalim producers have been practising eco-friendly farming since the beginning of Hansalim. Since then, with the introduction of the national eco-certification system, words such as organic and pesticide-free have been expanded, but the eco-friendliness of farming has been focused on inspection results and safety, such as the absence of harmful substances, rather than a series of processes and efforts to save the land.\nHansalim wants to go beyond this eco-friendly certification system and introduce participatory certification, which grants certification based on the entire production process. In participatory certification, the production community conducts its own inspections, and a frequent inspection team composed of producers, members, and practitioners visits the farming site to find out what is lacking and make improvements together.\nThis year, a total of 26 production communities are participating in participatory certification, and we hope to gradually expand it from next year and establish it as a certification system unique to Hansalim that can realize the values of the life-saving movement.",
