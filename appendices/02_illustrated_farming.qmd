## Hansalim Farming

![Hansalim farming is so precious](../images/appendix_02/01.jpeg)

## Separation distance

Keep a distance of at least 4 metres to prevent synthetic pesticides from being blown in from neighbouring conventional agricultural land. If distance is not sufficient, erect barriers at least 1 metre high.

## Homegrown

Individual producers or farming communities plant their own seeds and grow them into seedlings.

## No warming

We do not use fossil fuels to artificially raise temperatures, known as ‘greenhouse growing’. (Exceptions are made for special cases, such as cold storage)

## Irrigation

Install irrigation to prevent contaminated agricultural water from entering greenhouses and other facilities.

## Eco-friendly topsoil

Grow your seedlings in an eco-friendly topsoil that meets your standards, preferably topsoil that you make yourself.

## No synthetic pesticides

Herbicides and growth regulators are not used in the paddy fields where the crops are grown, nor in the furrows and boarders of the fields.

## Biodiversity

Without the use of herbicides and chemical fertilisers, a wide variety of paddy field creatures thrive.

## Circle of Life

Fermenting and composting animal manure from organic and antibiotic-free livestock farms. It can be used within communities and between communities, as well as on individual livestock farms.

## Soil Pesticide Testing

Newly acquired Hansalim farmland is tested for pesticide residues for two years prior to supply.

## Hansalim Production Communities

Hansalim farming is usually done as a community of at least five producers working together in a community.

## More specialty items

- Sprouts: Sprouts grown in the ground, not in water.
- Zucchini and cucumbers: zucchini and cucumbers that have grown to their full size and shape.
- Tomatoes: ripe tomatoes, harvested when they're red and ripe for nutrition.
- Strawberries: A particularly difficult crop to grow on your own, but one that thrives in the ground.
- Apples: apples that have not been sprayed with growth regulators that artificially extend their shelf life.
- Cage-free eggs: eggs laid by chickens that are raised on a grain and grass diet, starting the day after birth.
- Korean Barley-Fed Pork: Pigs raised on a diet containing Korean sprouted barley and Korean rice bran, minus imported corn that may be genetically modified.
